\begin{abstract}
Exoplanets have become a major focus in astronomy over the last decade due to
the rapid increase in the number of detected exoplanets. The detection of new
exoplanets will drive the future of astronomy. Our understanding of planetary
formation, the conditions for extraterrestrial life, and the location of
habitable worlds are directly dependent on obtaining high-quality observations
of exoplanets. There are a number of methods used to detect an exoplanet
through direct and indirect information. Direct detection of an exoplanet is
done by observing the exoplanet itself, while indirect detection is done by
observing changes in the star. No single detection method can determine
everything about an exoplanet, and each is biased toward certain kinds of
planets. The work presented here revolves around the problem of directly
detecting exoplanets that have been discovered indirectly 
via the ``radial velocity'' method.

The first part focuses on how to calculate the times when a planet with an
orbit fitted via the radial velocity will be detectable for a direct imaging
telescope. I analyze how to convert the orbit fits, estimate the probability of
detection as a function of time, and identify two major failure modes inherent
to the process.

In the second part, I identify a problem with a traditionally used method of
calculating the dimmest planet that can be detected for a given integration
time, the total time a star is observed. In creating higher fidelity models of
the signal to noise ratio for exoplanet detection, the signal and noise terms
have become inseparable which makes it impossible to calculate the dimmest
planet detectable as a function of integration time analytically. I demonstrate
a numerical routine to solve this problem and use it to calculate the
performance of the Roman Space Telescope's different observing scenarios on
known exoplanets.

Finally, I use that numerical routine to create a more accurate model to
estimate the probability of directly imaging an exoplanet detected via the
radial velocity method by accounting for additional sources of noise. I do this
by calculating the dimmest planet detectable over a direct imaging instrument's
possible planet-star separations, local zodiacal light values, and extra zodiacal
light values then comparing those values to the estimated positions and
brightnesses of planets consistent with the underlying radial velocity data. I
validate the work with a framework I developed for full simulations of the
process. The framework generates a set of radial velocity data for synthetic
exoplanets, fits orbits to the radial velocity data, calculates the probability
of detection, schedules observations, and simulates the observations. I show
that my scheduling algorithm has a high success rate, proving that direct
imaging observations of previously detected planets can be reliably scheduled.
