\begin{abstract}
Exoplanets have become a major focus in astronomy over the last two decades which has
driven a rapid increase in the number of detected exoplanets. The detection of new
exoplanets will drive the future of astronomy. Our understanding of planetary
formation, the conditions for extraterrestrial life, and the location of
habitable worlds are directly dependent on obtaining high-quality observations
of exoplanets. There are a number of methods used to detect an exoplanet
through direct and indirect observations. Direct detection of an exoplanet is
done by observing the exoplanet itself, while indirect detection is done by
observing changes in the star or circumstellar disk. No single detection method can determine
everything about an exoplanet, and each is biased toward certain kinds of
planets. The work presented here focuses on the problem of directly
detecting exoplanets that have been discovered indirectly 
via the ``radial velocity'' method.

The first part of the dissertation focuses on how to calculate the times when a
planet with an orbit fitted via the radial velocity detection method will be
detectable for a direct imaging telescope. The dissertation analyzes how to convert the orbit
fits, estimate the probability of detection as a function of time, and identify
two major failure modes inherent to the process.

The second part of the dissertation identifies a problem with a traditionally
used method of calculating the dimmest planet that can be detected for a given
integration time, the observing time spent collecting photons for science. In
creating higher fidelity models of the signal to noise ratio for exoplanet
detection, the signal and noise terms have become inseparable which makes it
impossible to calculate the dimmest planet detectable as a function of
integration time analytically. The dissertation demonstrate a numerical routine
to solve this problem and use it to calculate the performance of the Roman
Space Telescope's different observing scenarios on known exoplanets.

Finally, the dissertation uses the numerical routine to determine the dimmest
planet detectable to create a more accurate model to estimate the probability
of directly imaging an exoplanet detected via the radial velocity method by
accounting for additional sources of noise. The probability is found by using
the dimmest planet detectable over a direct imaging instrument's possible
planet-star separations, local zodiacal light values, and extra zodiacal light
values and comparing those values to the estimated positions and brightnesses
of planets consistent with the underlying radial velocity data. The probability
of detection metric is validated by creating a framework for full simulations
of the process. The framework generates a set of radial velocity data for
synthetic exoplanets, fits orbits to the radial velocity data, calculates the
probability of detection, schedules observations, and simulates the
observations. The scheduling algorithm is validated in a simulation of future
radial velocity and direct imaging instruments. In the simulation the
scheduling algorithm is compared against random searches and the algorithm, on
average, detects $\sim$32 unique planets in $\sim$375 days of integration time
while a random walk detects $\sim$17 unique planets in $\sim$720 days of
integration time. Finding twice as many planets in half the time is a
significant improvement and proves that direct imaging observations of
previously detected planets can be reliably scheduled with the assumed
instrument performance and mission design parameters.
