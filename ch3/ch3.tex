\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:accurate_pdet_intro}

As described in \Cref{cha:first_paper} future missions are expected to use
orbital information collected from radial velocity (RV) fits to create their
initial observation schedule. Directly imaging an Earth-like planet is very
dependent on the planet's position along its orbit because its orbital phase
determines the amount of light reflecting off the planet and the fact that at
smaller angular separation's $\alpha$ a telescope will collect less of the planet's
light. In \Cref{cha:first_paper} a method of creating orbits consistent
with the underlying radial velocity data was explained and the probability
of detection was calculated as
\begin{equation}
    P_{\textrm{det}}(t) = \frac{\textrm{Number of orbits detectable at time $t$}}{\textrm{Number of
    constructed orbits}}
.\end{equation}
This equation is an accurate description of the probability of detection
$P_\textrm{det}$, however the "Number of orbits detectable at time $t$" factor
was hiding a lot of factors. The constraints used to establish whether an orbit
was detectable were
\begin{align}
    \text{IWA} < \alpha < \text{OWA}\\
    \Delta\mathrm{mag} < \Delta\mathrm{mag}_0
\end{align}
where the $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ value is the flat instrument noise floor,
$\Delta\textrm{mag}$ is the planet-star difference in brightness magnitude, IWA
is the instrument's inner working angle, and OWA is the instrument's outer
working angle.

Then in \Cref{cha:coupling} we described that using a flat value of
$\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ will overestimate completeness and described how we can
calculate $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ as a function of various astrophysical inputs,
primarily the integration time $t_\textrm{int}$ and $\alpha$ when using an
optical system where the planet and background signals are coupled. Calculating
completeness as a function of more than the noise floor is a very
computationally demanding task, in an already computationally demanding process
of yield modeling, and many yield modeling tools and scheduling algorithms have
been built on the assumption of a flat limiting $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$
\citep{savranskyAnalyzingDesignsPlanetFinding2010,starkMaximizingExoEarthCandidate2014,
keithlyOptimalScheduling2020, garrettAnalyticalFormulation2016,
keithlyIntegrationTime2021, morganFasterExoEarth2021}.

Completeness has traditionally been used by yield modeling tools to establish
promising targets for a blind-search mission simulated in a Monte Carlo
fashion, the EXOSIMS approach \citep{savranskyEXOSIMSExoplanetOpenSource2017},
and to estimate yield by summing mission completeness, the Altruistic Yield
Optimization (AYO) approach \citep{starkMaximizingExoEarthCandidate2014}. Both
methods rely on rapid computation, sacrificing accuracy in the calculation of
completeness to allow for a better understanding of the mission design trade
space.

The work of this chapter is generate the most accurate probability of directly
imaging a planet for an individual observation. However, it is useful to
analyze the impact of different astrophysical inputs on the completeness metric
as it can help drive our intuition, since we will be applying the same 
criteria to determine detectability for both completeness and the probability
of directly imaging a planet that has an RV orbit fit.

In \Cref{sec:impact_on_completeness} we will first demonstrate the impact of
assuming a flat $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ value for calculations of completeness
and then expand it to include zodiacal and extra zodiacal light. Then in
\Cref{section:impact_on_pdet} we will relate the it to the probability of
detection metric $P_\textrm{det}$ that was described in \Cref{cha:first_paper},
ultimately expanding $P_\textrm{det}$ to account for variations in $t_\textrm{int}$, $\alpha$,
local zodiacal light, and extra zodiacal light.

% For example, the paper \citet{keithlyIntegrationTime2021} created a method
% of calculating complenetess
% The paper \citet{starkExoEarthYieldLandscape2019} calculates the contrast
% limit as a function of $\alpha$ but then assumes a flat noise floor due
% to an improvement in signal based on post-processing

\section{Impact of Separation and Zodiacal Light on Completeness}
\label{sec:impact_on_completeness}

As stated previously, calculating the photometric constraint as a function of
integration time has been shown to improve mission yield and target selection.
For completeness, we want an observation time-invariant quantity that
calculates the probability of detecting a set of planets from a given
population for a given telescope design. As the primary focus of the field is
on Earth-like planets that will be the planet population of interest here. The
parameters for the telescope shown in the rest of the chapter are taken from
\citet{morganExplorationExpectedNumber2022a} which aimed to simulate the yield
of a 6m telescope similar to the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory.

Yield estimates based on summed completeness are useful because they are much
faster than running full mission simulations. Typically they have been used to
study the effect of many different astrophysical inputs on mission yield
\citep{starkMaximizingExoEarthCandidate2014, Stark2016,
starkExoEarthYieldLandscape2019}. The standard way to calculate summed
completeness for a mission is to calculate the completeness per integration
time and then assign observation time to the most beneficial stars
\citep{hunyadiSingleVisitCompleteness2005,
starkMaximizingExoEarthCandidate2014}. After allocating observation time to
each target star it is a simple matter of summing the completeness for all
targets at their allocated observation time.

In \citep{starkExoEarthYieldLandscape2019} the instrument's contrast limit was
treated as a function of separation by calculating the core throughput at a
planet's separation and using that to determine the limiting contrast, however
it is difficult to discern what exactly the completeness constraints were because
there is an additional note saying that the post-processing noise floor is held to a constant
value and the code itself is not open source. Either way, with the
coupling described in \Cref{cha:coupling} we cannot use the same method to calculate
a $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ for completeness. The $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ value is instead
formulated by calling the minimization routine from \Cref{cha:coupling} 
for a given $t_\textrm{int}$, local zodiacal light surface brightness $n_\textrm{Z}$,
extra zodiacal light surface brightness $n_\textrm{EZ}$, and separation $\alpha$.

\subsection{Integration Time Example}
\label{sub:comp_per_inttime}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{ch3/figures/default_dmag_curve.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Plot of $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int})$ values without separation dependence
  overlaid on the PDF of an Earth-like planet HIP 91438 ($\approx$13 parsecs from Earth)
  if observed with a prospective design of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.
  Completeness for 30 days of integration time is 0.8.}
  \label{fig:default_dmag_curve}
\end{figure}

A good place to start is calculating completeness
as a function of integration time $t_\textrm{int}$. An example
is shown in \Cref{fig:default_dmag_curve}, where the colored rectangle
represents the calculated $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ values for a range of
$t_\textrm{int}$ values with $\alpha$ held constant to the mid point between
the IWA and OWA, $n_\textrm{EZ}=22 \frac{\textrm{mag}}{\textrm{arcsec}^2}$, and
$n_\textrm{Z}=23 \frac{\textrm{mag}}{\textrm{arcsec}^2}$. Because we have a
flat $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ the completeness can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
  c(t_\textrm{int}) = \int_{0}^{\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int})} 
  \int_{\alpha_\textrm{min}}^{\alpha_\textrm{max}} 
  f(\alpha, \Delta\textrm{mag})\textrm{d}\alpha \textrm{d}\Delta\textrm{mag}
  \label{eq:flat_comp_integral}
\end{equation}
where $f(\alpha, \Delta\textrm{mag})$ is the joint probability density function 
of an Earth-like planet population. In this scenario we see a very steep slope
initially and then little benefit after a few days of integration time.

% To reduce computation time
% $\Delta\textrm{mag}$ for a set of logarithmically spaced integration times we
% can interpolate smoothly and get the dimmest detectable $\Delta\textrm{mag}$
% for the star at an required integration time.


\subsection{Full Photometric Constraint}
\label{sub:full_comp}
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{ch3/figures/fZ_fEZ_curves.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{$\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, \alpha, n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ})$ for HIP 91438.
    Each column has a constant value of $n_\textrm{EZ}$ and each row has a
    constant value of $n_\textrm{Z}$. The zodiacal light values were generated
    using EXOSIMS to simulate the range of zodiacal light values of observing
  the star for a telescope at L2. TODO:make the nEZ values more representative.}
  \label{fig:fZ_fEZ_curves}
\end{figure}

By accounting for integration time, separation, zodiacal light, and extra
zodiacal light we end up with a four dimensional photometric constraint for
each star, $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, \alpha, n_\textrm{Z},
n_\textrm{EZ})$. These four dimensions are the range of input values necessary
to invert the exposure time calculator described by \citet{Nemati2014} for a
specific mission design. An example of the $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ curves for
various zodiacal light assumptions is shown in \Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_curves}. 

% Extra zodiacal light is unlikely to be known before a mission, but
% is worth keeping as an input so that different scenarios can be tested quickly.
% The zodiacal light can be estimated as a function of time if a telescope's
% orbit is known. However, in summed completeness simulations the time of
% observation is generally not considered so it would be of little use. 

To visualize the impact of separation and zodiacal light on completeness
we can formulate our limiting $\Delta\textrm{mag}$ as 
$\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, \alpha, n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ})$.
Then our equation for completeness becomes
\begin{equation}
  c(t_\textrm{int}, n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ}) = 
  \int_{\alpha_\textrm{min}}^{\alpha_\textrm{max}} 
  \int_{0}^{\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, \alpha, n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ})}
  f(\alpha, \Delta\textrm{mag})\textrm{d}\alpha \textrm{d}\Delta\textrm{mag}
  \label{eq:comp_integral}
\end{equation}
where we leave our zodiacal light values as inputs. In the best case scenario
the completeness is within 0.01 of the flat curve shown in
\Cref{fig:default_dmag_curve}, but drops considerably for high extra zodiacal
light values.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{ch3/figures/fZ_fEZ_comps_flat.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Completeness as a function of integration time for the same astrophysical
  scenarios as in \Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_curves}. The three lines represent different levels
  of accounting for separation and zodiacal light. The line for
  $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, \alpha, n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ})$
  is the most accurate as it accounts for the most variables and is 
  found by applying \Cref{eq:comp_integral} to the curve in \Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_curves}.
  The 
  $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, 0.55", n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ})$
  line shows the effect of calculating the completeness without accounting for
  the drop in $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ at small separations. And the
  $\Delta\mathrm{mag}_0(t_\mathrm{int}, 0.55$"$, 23, 22)$
  line is an overlay of the curve generated in \Cref{fig:default_dmag_curve}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{ch3/figures/mean_comp_errors.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Mean completeness error for different stars calculated as the mean difference between
  the default curve and the scenario curve in \Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_comps} for each star.}
  \label{fig:mean_comp_errors}
\end{figure}

To see the effect on completeness more clearly \Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_comps} shows
completeness as a function of integration time for the various scenarios in
\Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_curves} and compares them to the completeness curves generated
with less complete information. All of the values shown in
\Cref{fig:default_dmag_curve,fig:fZ_fEZ_curves,fig:fZ_fEZ_comps} are for a
single star and demonstrates the large trade space inherent to making
assumptions on the zodiacal light when maximizing completeness. Without
ensuring that observations are made near the minimum local zodiacal light value
a high completeness observation can drop to zero completeness. Values of extra
zodiacal light are unlikely to be known before an initial observation is made
so it cannot be treated 

\Cref{fig:mean_comp_errors} summarizes the effect that using the optimistic
"default" scenario of a flat limiting $\Delta\textrm{mag}$ per integration time
has. The targets shown are the 97 stars from the NEID Earth Twin Survey with
full stellar information in the Simbad database
\citep{guptaTargetPrioritization2021}. For each star the $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$
values are generated. Then the completeness per integration time function is
generated for both the case when $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ is assumed to be flat
and the case that takes separation into account, similar to
\Cref{fig:fZ_fEZ_comps}. We average the distance between the two completeness
per integration time functions and plot them as a single point in
\Cref{fig:mean_comp_errors}. It's clear that the change in limiting
$\Delta\textrm{mag}$ near the IWA becomes a problem past 10 parsecs. For
extreme extra zodiacal light values the effect becomes much more pronounced.

For yield modeling based on Monte Carlo mission simulations, such as EXOSIMS
\citep{savranskyWFIRSTAFTACoronagraphScience2015, delacroixScienceYield2016,
savranskyEXOSIMSExoplanetOpenSource2017}, the $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ values for
a star can be reused across mission simulations with the same telescope orbit
and optical system. It takes 20-30 seconds to run on a Ryzen 5800x 8 core
processor in parallel. An application of this could be to schedule observations
when accounting for the zodiacal light without requiring observations be made
at the zodiacal light minimum, such as \citet{keithlyOptimalScheduling2020}. In
that scheduler observations are all made at the minimum zodiacal light for the
target star. By allowing for observations at times near the minimum, the
scheduler can likely make worthwhile trades between targets.

\subsection{TODO:Exozodi calculations}
Given a distribution of zodi values for a planetary system we could marginalize
over it to calculate the completeness with respect to the possible zodi values
of an unknown planetary system.
\begin{equation}
  c(t_\textrm{int}, n_\textrm{Z}) = 
  \int_{n_\textrm{EZ,min}}^{n\textrm{EZ,max}} 
  \int_{\alpha_\textrm{min}}^{\alpha_\textrm{max}} 
  \int_{0}^{\Delta\textrm{mag}_0(t_\textrm{int}, \alpha, n_\textrm{Z}, n_\textrm{EZ})}
  f(\alpha, \Delta\textrm{mag}) \textrm{d}\alpha \textrm{d}\Delta\textrm{mag} \textrm{d}n_\textrm{EZ}
  \label{eq:comp_integral}
\end{equation}

% constraint is shown in The traditional set of dimmest detectable
% $\Delta\textrm{mag}$ values is shown in 

\section{Probability of Detection} % (fold)
\label{section:impact_on_pdet}

An interesting challenge for direct imaging is using the orbit fits of indirect
exoplanet detection techniques to estimate the best times to make direct
observations. Indirect detection via the radial velocity method cannot separate
the mass and inclination of a planet's orbit, which complicates direct imaging
scheduling because the inclination is important for the planet-star separation
and the mass is used to estimate the brightness of the planet. Chapter 2 showed
how to take a radial velocity fit and generate the most likely times the planet
will be detectable for a given instrument. Notably missing from that work was
considerations of integration time and zodiacal light conditions.

For a star with a planet fitted via the radial velocity method we can calculate
the dimmest detectable $\Delta\textrm{mag}$ curves, the $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$
values, for a telescope's orbit and optical system by looping over the zodiacal
light values for the star during the mission, the separations between the
instrument's IWA and OWA, and integration times spaced logarithmically between
the minimum and maximum allowed integration times. Logarithmic spacing is
useful as the largest changes in $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ occur at small
integration times. For each dimension used an interpolant the computation time
increases dramatically. In testing we found that the most useful process was
calculating 2d interpolants that return the dimmest detectable
$\Delta\textrm{mag}$ given an integration time and separation. We generate a 2d
interpolant for a set of 10 zodiacal values between the star's minimum and
maximum zodiacal light surface brightness during the telescope's orbit. 

Extra zodiacal light is treated similarly to the local zodiacal light in that
it is not included in the interpolants. Unlike the zodiacal light we cannot
come up with the surface brightnesses directly, instead we generate a range of
$n_\textrm{EZ}$ "zodis" as defined by
\citet{starkMaximizingExoEarthCandidate2014} and calculate the 2d interpolants
for a single value of $n_\textrm{EZ}$ zodi. For every separation in the
interpolant the extra zodiacal light surface brightness is calculated as if the
planet is at an inclination of $135\degree$, the inclination where the surface
brightness approaches its minimum. Calculating it in this fashion includes the
fact that the extra zodiacal light decreases for distant orbits.

Using the dimmest detectable $\Delta\textrm{mag}$ curves to calculate
probability of detection is useful because it means we do not need to calculate
the signal to noise ratio of every one of the orbit fits at every possible
observation time for all integration times. Instead we propagate to time $t$ in
($\alpha$, $\Delta\textrm{mag}$) space with the method shown in
\Cref{cha:first_paper}, get the interpolant corresponding to the local zodiacal
light for the target star at $t$, and call that 2d interpolant with all the
$\alpha$ and integration times which returns the dimmest detectable
$\Delta\textrm{mag}$ values of interest. Then the probability of detection for
an integration time is a simple percentage of the number of
$\Delta\textrm{mag}$ values from propagation that are above their corresponding
the $\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ values.

To demonstrate the process we generated synthetic radial velocity data for a
randomly generated planet drawn from occurrence rates from
\citet{dulzJointRadialVelocity2020} fixed to be on a circular orbit. The true
planet parameters are $T=653$ days, $i=91.28\degree$, $M_p=0.79 M_\oplus$, $R_p
= 0.944 R_\oplus$. The RV data was created with precision $\sigma=0.03$ m/s.
The fitting was done with \code{RadVel} \citep{fultonRadvelRadialVelocity2018}
via the \code{RVSearch} package \citep{rosenthalCaliforniaLegacy2021} which can
be seen in \Cref{fig:rv_fit}. Then a set of 10000 orbits consistent with the RV
fit were created using the "credible interval" method from Chapter 2 and
propagated in time as shown in \Cref{fig:pop_propagation_in_time}.

Then the process described above gives us the probability of detecting the
fitted planet as a function of both observation and integration time, shown in
\Cref{fig:pdet_colored_true_overlay}. The plot includes the detectability of
the true planet, calculated using EXOSIMS, which shows strong agreement with
the calculated probability of detection based on the RV fit. The only major
section where the probability of detection is high and the planet is not
detectable is when the true planet is inside the inner working angle around 1.1
years. This is shown in \Cref{fig:pop_propagation_in_time} and while the
estimated probability of detection is high it is not unity, because the
sampling of orbital inclination described in Chapter 2 captures the fact that
only very edge-on orbits will be inside the inner working angle. We show
the areas where the calculated probability of detection is above 0.99 and the
true planet is not detectable in \Cref{fig:pdet_colored_true_err}, which
shows that the model does a very good job of capturing the true detectability
of the planet with only a small range of values where the model and the true
detectability do not line up while the planet is near the telescope's IWA.

It further shows how the assumption on extra zodiacal light impacts the
resulting probability of detection, functioning similar to a safety factor. Choosing
a high $n_\textrm{EZ}$ value results in depressed probability of detection values
in exchange for more guarantee that any individual observation will be successful.

\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:con_ddMag_comp}

In this chapter we motivated the need to account for more astrophysical
parameters to estimate the probability of directly imaging a planet detected
with RV. We started by making an analogy to the completeness metric, a single
value to represent the likelihood of a detecting a planet from an assumed
population given a specific star and mission design, to show that separation
and zodiacal light values have a considerable impact. Then by calculating 
$\Delta\textrm{mag}_0$ as a function of integration time, angular separation,
zodiacal light, and extra zodiacal light we showed that we can very
accurately estimate the observation and integration times necessary to
directly image an exoplanet.
