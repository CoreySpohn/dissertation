  abstract = {The last two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain datasets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity and comparative robustness, Gaussian Processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such datasets. In this review we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modelling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain datasets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code, discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability, and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open source GP software packages. Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time domain astronomy for many years to come.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical study of stellar coronagraphy with apodized entrance apertures. The study is restricted to a perfect telescope operating in space, and a monochromatic on-axis unresolved star. It is shown that linear prolate functions are the optimal apodizers for rectangular apertures in stellar coronagraphy. With the phase mask technique (Roddier \& Roddier 1997), prolate functions can produce a total extinction of the star light. For Lyot's coronagraphy, the extinction is not complete, but prolate apodizations lead to an optimal star residual intensity with surprising interesting properties: the residual star light and the planet enjoy the same apodized intensity pattern (but different dynamic) with the optimal light concentration. With this technique, very high rejection rates can be obtained for Lyot's coronagraphy, with smaller mask sizes.},

  abstract = {The typical regulator system can frequently be described, in essentials, by differential equa-tions of no more than perhaps the second, third or fourth order. . . . In contrast, the order of the set of differential equations describing the typical negative feedback amplifier used in telephony is likely to be very much greater. As a matter of idle curiosity, I once counted to find out what the order of the set of equations in an amplifier I had just designed would have been, if I had worked with the differential equations directly. It turned out to be 55. Hendrik Bode, 1960 [Bod60]. This chapter introduces the concept of the transfer function, which is a compact description of the input/output relation for a linear time invariant system. Combin-ing transfer functions with block diagrams gives a powerful method for dealing with complex linear systems. The relationship between transfer functions and other descriptions of system dynamics is also discussed.},

In the PCTSP, each city has a given weight and penalty, and the goal is to collect a given quota of the weights of the cities while minimizing the length of the tour plus the penalties of the cities not in the tour. In the online version, cities are disclosed over time. We give a 7/3-competitive algorithm for the problem, which compares with a lower bound of 2 on the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm.

In this problem we receive a sequence of requests for service at nodes in a metric space and a time window for each request. The goal is to maximize the number of requests served during their time window. The time to traverse between two points is equal to the distance. Serving a request requires unit time. Irani et al., SODA 2002 considered the special case of a fixed size time window. In contrast, we consider the general case of an arbitrary size time window. We characterize the competitive ratio for each metric space separately. The competitive ratio depends on the relation between the minimum laxity (the minimum length of a time window) and the diameter of the metric space. Specifically, there exists a constant competitive algorithm only when the laxity is larger than the diameter. In addition, we characterize the rate of convergence of the competitive ratio, which approaches 1, as the laxity increases. Specifically, we provide matching lower and upper bounds. These bounds depend on the ratio between the laxity and the optimal TSP solution of the metric space (the minimum distance to traverse all nodes). An application of our result improves the previously known lower bound for colored packets with transition costs and matches the known upper bound. In proving our lower bounds we use an embedding with some special properties.},

Here we present estimates of how many exoplanets the TESS mission will detect, physical properties of the detected planets, and the properties of the stars that those planets orbit. This work uses stars drawn from the TESS Input Catalog Candidate Target List and revises yields from prior studies that were based on Galactic models. We modeled the TESS observing strategy to select approximately 200,000 stars at 2-minute cadence, while the remaining stars are observed at 30-min cadence in full-frame image data. We placed zero or more planets in orbit around each star, with physical properties following measured exoplanet occurrence rates, and used the TESS noise model to predict the derived properties of the detected exoplanets. In the TESS 2-minute cadence mode we estimate that TESS will find 1250+/-70 exoplanets (90\% confidence), including 250 smaller than 2 Earth-radii. Furthermore, we predict an additional 3100 planets will be found in full-frame image data orbiting bright dwarf stars and more than 10,000 around fainter stars. We predict that TESS will find 500 planets orbiting M-dwarfs, but the majority of planets will orbit stars larger than the Sun. Our simulated sample of planets contains hundreds of small planets amenable to radial velocity follow-up, potentially more than tripling the number of planets smaller than 4 Earth-radii with mass measurements. This sample of simulated planets is available for use in planning follow-up observations and analyses.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric characterization of directly imaged planets has thus far been limited to ground-based observations of young, self-luminous, Jovian planets. Near-term space- and ground- based facilities like \textbackslash emph\{WFIRST\} and ELTs will be able to directly image mature Jovian planets in reflected light, a critical step in support of future facilities that aim to directly image terrestrial planets in reflected light (e.g. HabEx, LUVOIR). These future facilities are considering the use of photometry to classify planets. Here, we investigate the intricacies of using colors to classify gas-giant planets by analyzing a grid of 9,120 theoretical reflected light spectra spread across different metallicities, pressure-temperature profiles, cloud properties, and phase angles. We determine how correlated these planet parameters are with the colors in the \textbackslash emph\{WFIRST\} photometric bins and other photometric bins proposed in the literature. Then we outline under what conditions giant planet populations can be classified using several supervised multivariate classification algorithms. We find that giant planets imaged in reflected light can be classified by metallicity with an accuracy of \${$>\$$}90\textbackslash\% if they are \textbackslash emph\{a prior\} known to not have significant cloud coverage in the visible part of the atmosphere, and at least 3 filter observations are available. If the presence of clouds is not known \textbackslash emph\{a priori\}, directly imaged planets can be more accurately classified by their cloud properties, as oppposed to metallicity or temperature. Furthermore, we are able to distinguish between cloudy and cloud-free populations with \${$>\$$}90\textbackslash\% accuracy with 3 filter observations. Our statistical pipeline is available on GitHub and can be extended to optimize science yield of future mission concepts.},

  abstract = {Robust optimization is still a relatively new approach to optimization problems affected by uncertainty, but it has already proved so useful in real applications that it is difficult to tackle such problems today without considering this powerful methodology. Written by the principal developers of robust optimization, and describing the main achievements of a decade of research, this is the first book to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject. Robust optimization is designed to meet some major challenges associated with uncertainty-affected optimization problems: to operate under lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty; to model the problem in a form that can be solved efficiently; and to provide guarantees about the performance of the solution. The book starts with a relatively simple treatment of uncertain linear programming, proceeding with a deep analysis of the interconnections between the construction of appropriate uncertainty sets and the classical chance constraints (probabilistic) approach. It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems. The theory is supported by numerous examples and computational illustrations. An essential book for anyone working on optimization and decision making under uncertainty, Robust Optimization also makes an ideal graduate textbook on the subject.},

  abstract = {Standard star photometry dominated the second part of the 20th century reaching its zenith in the 1980s. It was introduced to take advantage of the high sensitivity and large dynamic range of photomultiplier tubes compared to photographic plates. As the quantum e ciency of photodetectors improved and the wavelength range extended further to the red, standard systems were modi ed and re ned and deviations from the original systems proliferated. The revolutionary shift to area detectors for all optical and IR observations forced further changes to standard systems and the precision and accuracy of much broad and intermediate band photometry su ered until more suitable observational techniques and standard reduction procedures were adopted. But the biggest revolution occurred with the production of all-sky photometric surveys. Hipparcos/Tycho was space based, but most, like 2MASS, were ground-based dedicated survey telescopes. It is very likely that in the future, rather than making a measurement of an object in some standard photometric system, one will simply look up the magnitudes and colors of most objects in catalogs accessed from the Virtual Observatory. In this review the history of standard star photometry will be outlined and the calibration and realization of standard systems will be examined. Finally, model atmosphere uxes are now very realistic and synthetic photometry o ers the best prospects for calibrating all photometric systems. Synthetic photometry from observed spectrophotometry should also be used as a matter of course to provide colors within standard systems and to gain insights into the spectra and colors of unusual stars, star clusters and distant galaxies.},

Our implementation of this method, Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI), converges up to several orders of magnitude faster than two implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in this regime. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach by showing that OFTI calculates accurate posteriors for all existing astrometry of the exoplanet 51 Eri b up to 100 times faster than a Metropolis–Hastings MCMC. We demonstrate the accuracy of OFTI by comparing our results for several orbiting systems with those of various MCMC implementations, finding the output posteriors to be identical within shot noise. We also describe how our algorithm was used to successfully predict the location of 51 Eri b six months in the future based on less than three months of astrometry. Finally, we apply OFTI to 10 long-period exoplanets and brown dwarfs, all but one of which have been monitored over less than 3\% of their orbits, producing fits to their orbits from astrometric records in the literature.},

  abstract = {In robust optimization one seeks to make a decision under uncertainty, where the goal is to find the solution with the best worst-case performance. The set of possible realizations of the uncertain data is described by a so-called uncertainty set. In many scenarios, a decision maker may influence the uncertainty regime they are facing, for example, by investing in market research, or in machines which work with higher precision. Recently, this situation was addressed in the literature by introducing decision dependent uncertainty sets (endogenous uncertainty), i.e., uncertainty sets whose structure depends on (typically discrete) decision variables. In this way, one can model the trade-off between reducing the cost of robustness versus the cost of the investment necessary for influencing the uncertainty. However, there is another trade-off to be made here. With different uncertainty regimes, not only do the worst-case optimal solutions vary, but also other aspects of those solutions such as max-regret, best-case performance or predictability of the performance. A decision maker may still be interested in having a performance guarantee, but at the same time be willing to forgo superior worst-case performance if those other aspects can be enhanced by switching to a suitable uncertainty regime. We introduce the notion of uncertainty preference in order to capture such stances. We introduce a multi-objective optimization based and a bilevel optimization based model that integrate these preferences in a meaningful way. Further, we present three ways to formalize uncertainty preferences and study the resulting mathematical models. The goal is to have reformulations/approximations of these models which can be solved with standard methods. The workhorse is mixed-integer linear and conic optimization. We apply our framework to the uncertain shortest path problem and conduct numerical experiments for the resulting models. We can demonstrate that our models can be handled very well by standard mixed-integer linear solvers.},

By combining these three data types, one can measure precise masses and sometimes orbital parameters even when the observations cover a small fraction of an orbit. orvara achieves its computational performance with an eccentric anomaly solver five to ten times faster than commonly used approaches, low-level memory management to avoid python overheads, and by analytically marginalizing out parallax, barycenter proper motion, and the instrument-specific radial velocity zero points. Through its integration with the Hipparcos and Gaia intermediate astrometry package htof, orvara can properly account for the epoch astrometry measurements of Hipparcos and the measurement times and scan angles of individual Gaia epochs. We configure orvara with modifiable .ini configuration files tailored to any specific stellar or planetary system. We demonstrate orvara with a case study application to a recently discovered white dwarf/main sequence (WD/MS) system, HD 159062. By adding absolute astrometry to literature RV and relative astrometry data, our comprehensive MCMC analysis improves the precision of HD 159062B’s mass by more than an order of magnitude to 0.6083+0.0083 −0.0073M. We also derive a low eccentricity and large semimajor axis, establishing HD 159062AB as a system that did not experience Roche lobe overflow.},

  abstract = {We study the selection effects imposed by a central field obscuration on direct searches for companions to stars. We analyze both ‘‘specific’’ versions of obscurational completeness, which depend explicitly on the semimajor axis and eccentricity of companion orbits, and ‘‘ensemble’’ versions, which integrate over a companion population represented by probability distributions for semimajor axis and eccentricity. In the case of effectively nonmoving companions (orbital periods significantly longer than the observing program) or for a single observation, we find that high completeness requires obscurations much smaller than the smallest orbit size of interest. For example, to achieve 95\% obscurational completeness for a particular orbit size on a single visit, the obscuration must be less than   1 3 that orbit size. For relevant ensembles of terrestrial planets, an observing program can find more than 95\% of all companions in less than three visits over 3 months—if the obscuration is smaller than the smallest orbit of interest. If the obscuration is larger, but not larger than the largest orbit of interest, then the design obscurational completeness is reduced, but 95\% of all the planets that can ever be found are found by less than six visits over 2–5 yr. Nevertheless, achieving such high completeness when the ensemble is only partly resolved calls for several low-yield visits.},

We develop a completeness function for Earth-like planets on "habitable" orbits for an instrument with a central field obscuration, uniform sensitivity in an annular detection zone, and limiting sensitivity that is expressed as a "delta magnitude" with respect to the star, determined by systematic effects (given adequate exposure time). We demonstrate our method of estimation by applying it to our understanding of the coronagraphic version of the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF-C) mission as of October 2004. We establish an initial relationship between the size, quality, and stability of the instrument's optics and its ability to meet mission science requirements. We provide options for increasing the fidelity and versatility of the models on which our method is based, and we discuss how the method could be extended to model the TPF-C mission as a whole, to verify that its design can meet the science requirements.},

Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter-mass planets out to 20 au for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends that indicate the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 au. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 ± 5\% over the range 1-20 MJup and 5-20 au. Our data also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 au, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 au. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3 and 10 au, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall population of gas giant planets. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

We tabulate a list of 357 significant periodic signals that are of constant period and phase, and not coincident in period and/or phase with stellar activity indices. These signals are thus strongly suggestive of barycentric reflex motion of the star induced by one or more candidate exoplanets in Keplerian motion about the host star. Of these signals, 225 have already been published as planet claims, 60 are classified as significant unpublished planet candidates that await photometric follow-up to rule out activity-related causes, and 54 are also unpublished, but are classified as “significant” signals that require confirmation by additional data before rising to classification as planet candidates. Of particular interest is our detection of a candidate planet with M\textbackslash sin (I)=3.8 \{M\}\textbackslash oplus , and P = 9.9 days orbiting Lalande 21185, the fourth-closest main-sequence star to the Sun. For each of our exoplanetary candidate signals, we provide the period and semi-amplitude of the Keplerian orbital fit, and a likelihood ratio estimate of its statistical significance.

  abstract = {First generation space-based optical coronagraphic telescopes will obtain images of cool gas-and ice-giant exoplanets around nearby stars. Exoplanets lying at planet-star separations larger than about 1AU-where an exoplanet can be resolved from its parent star-have spectra that are dominated by reflected light to beyond 1 μm and punctuated by molecular absorption features. Here, we consider how exoplanet albedo spectra and colors vary as a function of planet-star separation, metallicity, mass, and observed phase for Jupiter and Neptune analogs from 0.35 to 1 μm. We model Jupiter analogs with 1 × and 3 × the solar abundance of heavy elements, and Neptune analogs with 10× and 30× the solar abundance of heavy elements. Our model planets orbit a solar analog parent star at separations of 0.8 AU, 2 AU, 5 AU, and 10 AU. We use a radiative-convective model to compute temperature-pressure profiles. The giant exoplanets are found to be cloud-free at 0.8 AU, possess H2O clouds at 2 AU, and have both NH3 and H2O clouds at 5AU and 10 AU. For each model planet we compute moderate resolution (R = λ/Δλ ∼ 800) albedo spectra as a function of phase. We also consider low-resolution spectra and colors that are more consistent with the capabilities of early direct imaging capabilities. As expected, the presence and vertical structure of clouds strongly influence the albedo spectra since cloud particles not only affect optical depth but also have highly directional scattering properties. Observations at different phases also probe different volumes of atmosphere as the source-observer geometry changes. Because the images of the planets themselves will be unresolved, their phase will not necessarily be immediately obvious, and multiple observations will be needed to discriminate between the effects of planet-star separation, metallicity, and phase on the observed albedo spectra. We consider the range of these combined effects on spectra and colors. For example, we find that the spectral influence of clouds depends more on planet-star separation and hence atmospheric temperature than metallicity, and it is easier to discriminate between cloudy 1× and 3× Jupiters than between 10 × and 30 × Neptunes. In addition to alkalis and methane, our Jupiter models show H2O absorption features near 0.94 μm. While solar system giant planets are well separated by their broadband colors, we find that arbitrary giant exoplanets can have a large range of possible colors and that color alone cannot be relied upon to characterize planet types. We also predict that giant exoplanets receiving greater insolation than Jupiter will exhibit higher equator-to-pole temperature gradients than are found on Jupiter and thus may exhibit differing atmospheric dynamics. These results are useful for future interpretation of direct imaging exoplanet observations as well as for deriving requirements and designing filters for optical direct imaging instrumentation. © 2010.

The data challenge is hosted on the CodaLab competition platform, where participants can upload their results. The specifications of the data challenge are published on our website https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/. The first phase, launched on the 1st of September 2019 and closed on the 1st of October 2020, consisted in detecting point sources in two types of common data-set in the field of high-contrast imaging: data taken in pupil-tracking mode at one wavelength (subchallenge 1, also referred to as ADI) and multispectral data taken in pupil-tracking mode (subchallenge 2, also referred to as ADI+mSDI). In this paper, we describe the approach, organisational lessons-learnt and current limitations of the data challenge, as well as preliminary results of the participants’ submissions for this first phase. In the future, we plan to provide permanent access to the standard library of data sets and metrics, in order to guide the validation and support the publications of innovative image processing algorithms dedicated to high-contrast imaging of planetary systems.},

  abstract = {We model the settlement of the galaxy by space-faring civilizations in order to address issues related to the Fermi Paradox. We explore the problem in a way that avoids assumptions about the intent and motivation of any exo-civilization seeking to settle other planetary systems. We first consider the speed of an advancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if the galaxy can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales shorter than its age. We also include the effect of stellar motions on the long term behavior of the settlement front which adds a diffusive component to its advance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way can be readily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions about interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the question of the galactic steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of settled planets. We do this by considering the effect of finite settlement civilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters for which the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring civilizations even though some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results point to ways in which Earth might remain unvisited in the midst of an inhabited galaxy. Finally we consider how our results can be combined with the finite horizon for evidence of previous settlements in Earth's geologic record. Our steady-state model can constrain the probabilities for an Earth visit by a settling civilization before a given time horizon. These results break the link between Hart's famous "Fact A" (no interstellar visitors on Earth now) and the conclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization in the galaxy.},

  abstract = {Cool main-sequence, subgiant, and red giant stars all show solar-like oscillations, pulsations that are excited and intrinsically damped by near-surface convection. Many overtones are typically excited to observable amplitudes, giving a rich spectrum of detectable modes. These modes provide a wealth of information on fundamental stellar properties. However, the radial velocity (RV) shifts induced by these oscillations can also be problematic when searching for low-mass, long-period planets; this is because their amplitudes are large enough to completely mask such minute planetary signals. Here we show how fine-tuning exposure times to the stellar parameters can help efficiently average out the solar-like, oscillation-induced shifts. To reduce the oscillation signal to the RV precision commensurate with an Earth analog, we find that for cool, low-mass stars (near spectral type K), the necessary exposure times may be as short as ∼4 minutes, while for hotter, higher-mass stars (near spectral type F, or slightly evolved), the required exposure times can be longer than 100 minutes. We provide guideline exposure durations required to suppress the total observed amplitude due to oscillations to a level of 0.1 m s-1, and a level corresponding to the Earth-analog reflex amplitude for the star. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic variability of the oscillations, we recommend in practice choosing short exposure durations at the telescope and then averaging over those exposures later, as guided by our predictions. To summarize, as we enter an era of 0.1 m s-1 instrumental precision, it is critical to tailor our observing strategies to the stellar properties.},

  abstract = {Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical object. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present am unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at \$2.0\_\{-0.6\}\^\{+0.7\} M\_\textbackslash oplus\$, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.},

Physical characterization of NEOs using ground-based photometric, spectral, and radar observations, along with in situ measurements from spacecraft, all contribute to a better understanding of these objects. Orbit characterization is based on optical and radar astrometric observations; this paper outlines some of the orbit determination techniques. The accuracy of the orbit solution depends primarily on the length of the time span over which the object is observed. Radar observations can also dramatically improve the accuracy of an orbit solution. Once an orbit has been computed, future close approaches can be predicted along with their uncertainties. This paper outlines methods for computing the impact probability as a function of close approach uncertainties. No known NEO has any significant chance of impacting the Earth in the next fifty to a hundred years. The report last year suggesting that asteroid 1997 XF11 might hit the Earth in the year 2028 was a false alarm. A complete analysis of the close approach uncertainties shows that an impact in 2028 could be ruled out, even without additional pre-discovery observations. If an object were discovered to be on a collision course with Earth, the warning time could range anywhere from hours to decades, the most important factor being how early the object is discovered.},

  abstract = {Historically, Fortran and C have been the default programming languages in High-Performance Computing (HPC). In both, programmers have primitives and functions available that allow manipulating system memory and interacting directly with the underlying hardware, resulting in efficient code in both response times and resource use. On the other hand, it is a real challenge to generate code that is maintainable and scalable over time in these types of languages. In 2010, Rust emerged as a new programming language designed for concurrent and secure applications, which adopts features of procedural, object-oriented and functional languages. Among its design principles, Rust is aimed at matching C in terms of efficiency, but with increased code security and productivity. This paper presents a comparative study between C and Rust in terms of performance and programming effort, selecting as a case study the simulation of N computational bodies (N-Body), a popular problem in the HPC community. Based on the experimental work, it was possible to establish that Rust is a language that reduces programming effort while maintaining acceptable performance levels, meaning that it is a possible alternative to C for HPC.},

  abstract = {Precise mass measurements of exoplanets discovered by the direct imaging or transit technique are required to determine planet bulk properties and potential habitability. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that, for the foreseeable future, the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) measurement technique is the only method potentially capable of detecting and measuring the masses and orbits of habitable-zone Earths orbiting nearby F, G, and K spectral-type stars from the ground. In particular, EPRV measurements with a precision of better than approximately 10 cm/s (with a few cm/s stability over many years) are required. Unfortunately, for nearly a decade, PRV instruments and surveys have been unable to routinely reach RV accuracies of less than roughly 1 m/s. Making EPRV science and technology development a critical component of both NASA and NSF program plans is crucial for reaching the goal of detecting potentially habitable Earthlike planets and supporting potential future exoplanet direct imaging missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) or the Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). In recognition of these facts, the 2018 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Exoplanet Science Strategy (ESS) report recommended the development of EPRV measurements as a critical step toward the detection and characterization of habitable, Earth-analog planets. In response to the NAS-ESS recommendation, NASA and NSF commissioned the EPRV Working Group to recommend a ground-based program architecture and implementation plan to achieve the goal intended by the NAS. This report documents the activities, findings, and recommendations of the EPRV Working Group.},

  abstract = {We analyze 8 years of precise radial velocity measurements from the Keck Planet Search, characterizing the detection threshold, selection effects, and completeness of the survey. We carry out a systematic search for planets by assessing the false alarm probability associated with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time baseline of the observations, and size of measurement errors and stellar jitter. We show that all planets with orbital periods {$<$}2000 days, velocity amplitudes {$>$}20 m/s, and eccentricities {$<$}0.6 have been announced, and summarize the candidates at lower amplitudes and longer orbital periods. For the remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of a companion, typically 10 m/s, and use the non-detections to derive completeness corrections at low amplitudes and long orbital periods. We give the fraction of stars with a planet as a function of planet mass and orbital period, and extrapolate to long period orbits and low planet masses. A power law fit for planet masses {$>$}0.3 Jupiter masses and periods {$<$}2000 days gives a mass-period distribution dN=C M\^\textbackslash alpha P\^\textbackslash beta dlnM dlnP with \textbackslash alpha=-0.31 \textbackslash pm 0.2, \textbackslash beta=0.26\textbackslash pm 0.1, and the normalization constant C such that 10.5\% of solar type stars have a planet with mass in the range 0.3-10 Jupiter masses and orbital period 2-2000 days. The orbital period distribution shows an increase in the planet fraction by a factor of 5 for orbital periods beyond 300 days. Extrapolation gives 17-20\% of stars having gas giant planets within 20 AU. Finally, taking into account differences in detectability, we find that M dwarfs are 3 to 10 times less likely to harbor a Jupiter mass planet than solar type stars.},

The GPS and SLR annual signals agree but are different (16\%) to the load model. Subtraction of the load model removes the annual variation from GPS, SLR, and GRACE, and the semi-annual variation in GPS. The GPS and SLR long-term signals are highly correlated, but GPS is better correlated with the loading model. Subtraction of the load model removes the 1998 anomaly from the GPS J2 series but not completely from the SLR J2 series, suggesting that the SLR anomaly may not be entirely due to mass re-distribution as has been presumed.},

  abstract = {Exozodiacal dust, warm debris from comets and asteroids in and near the habitable zone of stellar systems, reveals the physical processes that shape planetary systems. Scattered light from this dust is also a source of background flux which must be overcome by future missions to image Earthlike planets. This study quantifies the sensitivity of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph to light scattered by exozodi, the zodiacal dust around other stars. Using a sample of 149 nearby stars, previously selected for optimum detection of habitable exoplanets by space observatories, we find the maximum number of exozodiacal disks with observable inner habitable zone boundaries is six and the number of observable outer habitable boundaries is 74. One zodi was defined as the visible-light surface brightness of 22 m V arcsec−2 around a solar-mass star, approximating the scattered light brightness in visible light at the Earth-equivalent insolation. In the speckle limited case, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited by speckle temporal stability rather than shot noise, the median 5σ sensitivity to habitable zone exozodi is 12 zodi per resolution element. This estimate is calculated at the inner-working angle of the coronagraph, for the current best estimate performance, neglecting margins on the uncertainty in instrument performance and including a post-processing speckle suppression factor. For an log-norm distribution of exozodi levels with a median exozodi of 3× the solar zodi, we find that the Roman Coronagraph would be able to make 5σ detections of exozodiacal disks in scattered light from 13 systems with a 95\% confidence interval spanning 7–20 systems. This sensitivity allows Roman Coronagraph to complement ground-based measurements of exozodiacal thermal emission and constrain dust albedos. Optimized post-processing and detection of extended sources in multiple resolution elements is expected to further improve this unprecedented sensitivity to light scattered by exozodiacal dust.},

Although these missions could conduct a survey of high-priority target stars to detect candidate Earth-like planets, conducting a precursor radial velocity (RV) survey will benefit future direct imaging missions in four ways. First, an RV survey capable of detecting signals as small as 8 cm/s over timescales of a few years could discover potentially habitable Earth-mass planets orbiting dozens of nearby GKM stars accessible to space-based direct imaging. Second, RVs will improve scheduling efficiency by reducing the required number of revisits for orbit determination, and revealing when a planet of interest is most observable. Third, RV observations will reveal the masses of gas and ice giants that could be mistaken for Earth-mass planets, thereby reducing the time spent identifying false positives. Fourth, mass measurements from RVs will provide the surface gravities necessary for interpreting atmospheric spectra and potential biosignatures.},

Forthcoming and proposed NASA missions, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx), and the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR), are expected to be equipped with sensitive coronagraphs and/or starshades. We are developing a suite of numerical simulations to quantify the extent to which ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys could boost the detection efficiency of direct imaging missions. In this paper, we discuss the first step in the process of estimating planet yields: generating synthetic planetary systems consistent with observed occurrence rates from multiple detection methods. In an attempt to self-consistently populate stars with orbiting planets, it is found that naive extrapolation of occurrence rates (mass, semi-major axis) results in an unrealistically large number-density of Neptune-mass planets beyond the ice-line (\$a \textbackslash gtrsim 5\$au), causing dynamic interactions that would destabilize orbits. We impose a stability criterion for multi-planet systems based on mutual Hill radii separation. Considering the influence of compact configurations containing Jovian-mass and Neptune-mass planets results in a marked suppression in the number of terrestrial planets that can exist at large radii. This result has a pronounced impact on planet yield calculations particularly in regions accessible to high-contrast imaging and microlensing. The dynamically compact configurations and occurrence rates that we develop may be incorporated as input into joint RV and direct imaging yield calculations to place meaningful limits on the number of detectable planets with future missions.},

We model the star simultaneously in the fit and provide several state-of-the-art ways to constrain its properties, including taking advantage of the now-ubiquitous all-sky catalog photometry and Gaia parallaxes. EXOFASTv2 can model the star by itself, too. Multi-planet systems are modeled self-consistently with the same underlying stellar mass that defines their semi-major axes through Kepler's law and the planetary period. Transit timing, duration, and depth variations can be modeled with a simple command line option. We explain our methodology and rationale as well as provide an improved version of the core transit model that is both 25\% faster and more accurate. We highlight several potential pitfalls in exoplanet modeling, including the handling of eccentricity in transit-only fits, that the standard exoplanet convention for ω uses a left-handed coordinate system, contrary to most modern textbooks, how to avoid an important degeneracy when allowing negative companion masses, and a widely unappreciated, potential 10-minute ambiguity in the reported transit times. EXOFASTv2 is available at https://github.com/jdeast/EXOFASTv2. The code is written in IDL, and includes an executable that can be run freely and legally without an IDL license or any knowledge of the language. Extensive documentation and tutorials are included in the distribution for a variety of example fits. Advanced amateurs and undergrads have successfully performed sophisticated global fits of complex planetary systems with EXOFASTv2.

The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \$\textbackslash sim N\^2\$ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

  abstract = {The simplicial homology global optimisation (SHGO) algorithm is a general purpose global optimisation algorithm based on applications of simplicial integral homology and combinatorial topology. SHGO approximates the homology groups of a complex built on a hypersurface homeomorphic to a complex on the objective function. This provides both approximations of locally convex subdomains in the search space through Sperner’s lemma and a useful visual tool for characterising and efficiently solving higher dimensional black and grey box optimisation problems. This complex is built up using sampling points within the feasible search space as vertices. The algorithm is specialised in finding all the local minima of an objective function with expensive function evaluations efficiently which is especially suitable to applications such as energy landscape exploration. SHGO was initially developed as an improvement on the topographical global optimisation (TGO) method. It is proven that the SHGO algorithm will always outperform TGO on function evaluations if the objective function is Lipschitz smooth. In this paper SHGO is applied to non-convex problems with linear and box constraints with bounds placed on the variables. Numerical experiments on linearly constrained test problems show that SHGO gives competitive results compared to TGO and the recently developed Lc-DISIMPL algorithm as well as the PSwarm, LGO and DIRECT-L1 algorithms. Furthermore SHGO is compared with the TGO, basinhopping (BH) and differential evolution (DE) global optimisation algorithms over a large selection of black-box problems with bounds placed on the variables from the SciPy benchmarking test suite. A Python implementation of the SHGO and TGO algorithms published under a MIT license can be found from https://bitbucket.org/upiamcompthermo/shgo/.},

  abstract = {Abstract Initial design and validation of baseline Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) at NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) are described. The OSSEs mimic the procedures used to analyze global observations for specifying states of the atmosphere. As simulations, however, OSSEs are not only confined to already existing observations and they provide a perfect description of the true state being analyzed. These two properties of the simulations can be exploited to improve both existing and envisioned observing systems and the algorithms to analyze them. Preliminary to any applications, however, the OSSE framework must be adequately validated. This first version of the simulated observations is drawn from a 13 month simulation of nature produced by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. These observations include simulated errors of both instruments and representativeness. Since the statistics of analysis and forecast errors are partially determined by these observational errors, their appropriate modelling can be crucial for validating the realism of the OSSE. That validation is performed by comparing the statistics of the results of assimilating these simulated observations for one summer month compared with the corresponding statistics obtained from assimilating real observations during the same time of year. The assimilation system is the three-dimensional variational analysis (GSI) scheme used at both the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and GMAO. Here, only statistics concerning observation innovations or analysis increments within the troposphere are considered for the validation. In terms of the examined statistics, the OSSE is validated remarkably well, even with some simplifications currently employed. In order to obtain this degree of success, it was necessary to employ horizontally correlated observation errors for both atmospheric motion vectors and some satellite observed radiances. The simulated observations with added observation errors appear suitable for some initial OSSE applications.},

  abstract = {The orbital distribution of giant planets is crucial for understanding how terrestrial planets form and predicting yields of exoplanet surveys. Here, we derive giant planets occurrence rates as a function of orbital period by taking into account the detection efficiency of the Kepler and radial velocity (RV) surveys. The giant planet occurrence rates for Kepler and RV show the same rising trend with increasing distance from the star. We identify a break in the RV giant planet distribution between ∼2 and 3 au—close to the location of the snow line in the solar systemafter which the occurrence rate decreases with distance from the star. Extrapolating a broken power-law distribution to larger semimajor axes, we find good agreement with the ∼1\% planet occurrence rates from direct imaging surveys. Assuming a symmetric power law, we also estimate that the occurrence of giant planets between 0.1 and 100 au is -+ 26.6 \% 5.4 7.5 for planets with masses 0.1–20 MJ and decreases to -+ 6.2 \% 1.2 1.5 for planets more massive than Jupiter. This implies that only a fraction of the structures detected in disks around young stars can be attributed to giant planets. Various planet population synthesis models show good agreement with the observed distribution, and we show how a quantitative comparison between model and data can be used to constrain planet formation and migration mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The Second Workshop on Extreme Precision Radial Velocities defined circa 2015 the state of the art Doppler precision and identified the critical path challenges for reaching 10 cm/s measurement precision. The presentations and discussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop recommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here. Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph, technological advances for precision radial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable instruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to produce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision radial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. Center of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals. Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial velocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.},

  abstract = {We report 18 years of Doppler shift measurements of a nearby star, 55 Cancri, that exhibit strong evidence for five orbiting planets. The four previously reported planets are strongly confirmed here. A fifth planet is presented, with an apparent orbital period of 260 days, placing it 0.78 AU from the star in the large empty zone between two other planets. The velocity wobble amplitude of 4.9 \textbackslash ms implies a minimum planet mass \textbackslash msini = 45.7 \textbackslash mearthe. The orbital eccentricity is consistent with a circular orbit, but modest eccentricity solutions give similar \textbackslash chisq fits. All five planets reside in low eccentricity orbits, four having eccentricities under 0.1. The outermost planet orbits 5.8 AU from the star and has a minimum mass, \textbackslash msini = 3.8 \textbackslash mjupe, making it more massive than the inner four planets combined. Its orbital distance is the largest for an exoplanet with a well defined orbit. The innermost planet has a semi-major axis of only 0.038 AU and has a minimum mass, \textbackslash msinie, of only 10.8 \textbackslash mearthe, one of the lowest mass exoplanets known. The five known planets within 6 AU define a \{\textbackslash em minimum mass protoplanetary nebula\} to compare with the classical minimum mass solar nebula. Numerical N-body simulations show this system of five planets to be dynamically stable and show that the planets with periods of 14.65 and 44.3 d are not in a mean-motion resonance. Millimagnitude photometry during 11 years reveals no brightness variations at any of the radial velocity periods, providing support for their interpretation as planetary.},

Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90\% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of \textasciitilde 0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are \textasciitilde 40\%-50\% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

We have implemented real-time MCMC convergence tests to ensure adequate sampling of the posterior. RadVel can output a number of publication-quality plots and tables. Users may interface with RadVel through a convenient command-line interface or directly from Python. The code is object-oriented and thus naturally extensible.

We also describe a new target star selection metric with no dependence on an assumed planet population that can be used as a proxy for single-visit completeness. This approach allows for the recovery of the total mission completeness via convolution of the depth of search grid with an equivalent grid of assumed occurrence rates and integration over the part of the grid representing the population of interest (e.g., Earth-like planets on habitable zone orbits, etc.). In this work, we discuss the practical details of calculating the depth of search and present results of such calculations for one design iteration of the WFIRST coronagraphs.},

  author = {Gavin, Henri P.},
  year = {2019},
  journal = {Duke University},
  pages = {1--19},
  abstract = {The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was developed in the early 1960's to solve ne onlinear least squares problems. Least squares problems arise in the context of fitting a parameterized function to a set of measured data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the errors between the data points and the function. If the fit function is not linear in the parameters the least squares problem is nonlinear. Nonlinear least squares methods iteratively reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the function and the measured data points through a sequence of updates to parameter values. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combines two minimization methods: the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method. In the gradient descent method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by updating the parameters in the steepest-descent direction. In the Gauss-Newton method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by assuming the least squares function is locally quadratic, and finding the minimum of the quadratic. The Levenberg-Marquardt method acts more like a gradient-descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value, and acts more like the Gauss-Newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value. This document describes these methods and illustrates the use of software to solve nonlinear least squares curve-fitting problems.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery and validation of a three-planet system orbiting the nearby (31.1 pc) M2 dwarf star TOI-700 (TIC 150428135). TOI-700 lies in the TESS continuous viewing zone in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere; observations spanning 11 sectors reveal three planets with radii ranging from 1 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ to 2.6 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ and orbital periods ranging from 9.98 to 37.43 days. Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enable us to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the system of planets. The outermost planet, TOI-700 d, has a radius of \$1.19\textbackslash pm0.11\$ R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$ and resides in the conservative habitable zone of its host star, where it receives a flux from its star that is approximately 86\% of the Earth's insolation. In contrast to some other low-mass stars that host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, TOI-700 exhibits low levels of stellar activity, presenting a valuable opportunity to study potentially-rocky planets over a wide range of conditions affecting atmospheric escape. While atmospheric characterization of TOI-700 d with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be challenging, the larger sub-Neptune, TOI-700 c (R = 2.63 R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$), will be an excellent target for JWST and beyond. TESS is scheduled to return to the Southern Hemisphere and observe TOI-700 for an additional 11 sectors in its extended mission, which should provide further constraints on the known planet parameters and searches for additional planets and transit timing variations in the system.},

The OP is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the OP, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

  abstract = {Tens of thousands of solar-like oscillating stars have been observed by space missions. Their photometric variability in the Fourier domain can be parameterized by a sum of two super-Lorentizian functions for granulation and a Gaussian-shaped power excess for oscillation. The photometric granulation/oscillation parameters scale with stellar parameters and they can also make predictions for corresponding parameters in radial velocity measurements. Based on scaling relations, we simulate realistic radial velocity time series and examine how the root-mean-square scatter of radial velocity measurements varies with stellar parameters and different observation strategies such as the length of integration time and gaps in the time series. Using stars with extensive spectroscopic observations from the spectrographs (SONG and HARPS), we measure the granulation amplitude and timescale from the power spectrum of the radial velocity time series. We compare these measurements with literature values based on Kepler photometry. We find that the granulation amplitude in radial velocity can be well predicted from the photometry and scaling relations. Both granulation timescales in radial velocity agree with those predicted from photometry for giants and sub-giants. However, for main-sequence stars, only one granulation timescale in radial velocity is in agreement with the photometric-based values, while the other timescale generally lies at lower frequencies compared to the result of photometry. In conclusion, we show the photometric scaling relations from Kepler photometry and the scaling relationship to Doppler observations can be very useful for predicting the photometric and radial velocity stellar variabilities due to stellar granulation and oscillation.},

Even if we take advantage of the extreme instrumental precision conferred by NEID, it will be difficult to disentangle the weak (∼10 cm s-1) signals induced by such low-mass, long-period exoplanets from stellar noise for all but the quietest host stars. In this work, we present a set of quantitative selection metrics which we use to identify an initial NETS target list consisting of stars conducive to the detection of exoplanets in the regime of interest. We also outline a set of observing strategies with which we aim to mitigate uncertainty contributions from intrinsic stellar variability and other sources of noise.},

  abstract = {High-precision astrometry can identify exoplanets and measure their orbits and masses while coronagraphic imaging enables detailed characterization of their physical properties and atmospheric compositions through spectroscopy. In a previous paper, we showed that a diffractive pupil telescope (DPT) in space can enable sub-μas accuracy astrometric measurements from wide-field images by creating faint but sharp diffraction spikes around the bright target star. The DPT allows simultaneous astrometric measurement and coronagraphic imaging, and we discuss and quantify in this paper the scientific benefits of this combination for exoplanet science investigations: identification of exoplanets with increased sensitivity and robustness, and ability to measure planetary masses to high accuracy. We show how using both measurements to identify planets and measure their masses offers greater sensitivity and provides more reliable measurements than possible with separate missions, and therefore results in a large gain in mission efficiency. The combined measurements reliably identify potentially habitable planets in multiple systems with a few observations, while astrometry or imaging alone would require many measurements over a long time baseline. In addition, the combined measurement allows direct determination of stellar masses to percent-level accuracy, using planets as test particles. We also show that the DPT maintains the full sensitivity of the telescope for deep wide-field imaging, and is therefore compatible with simultaneous scientific observations unrelated to exoplanets. We conclude that astrometry, coronagraphy, and deep wide-field imaging can be performed simultaneously on a single telescope without significant negative impact on the performance of any of the three techniques. © 2013.

Such an instrument performance budget is a necessity for both identifying the variety of noise sources currently limiting Doppler measurements, and estimating the achievable performance of next generation exoplanet hunting Doppler spectrometers. For these instruments, no single source of instrumental error is expected to set the overall measurement floor. Rather, the overall instrumental measurement precision is set by the contribution of many individual error sources. We use a combination of numerical simulations, educated estimates based on published materials, extrapolations of physical models, results from laboratory measurements of spectroscopic subsystems, and informed upper limits for a variety of error sources to identify likely sources of systematic error and construct our global instrument performance error budget. While natively focused on the performance of the NEID instrument, this modular performance budget is immediately adaptable to a number of current and future instruments. Such an approach is an important step in charting a path towards improving Doppler measurement precisions to the levels necessary for discovering Earth-like planets.},

This is achieved by utilizing compressed sensing techniques,which aremodified to be compatible with theGaussian process framework. The resulting tool can be used like a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and has the same aspect but with much fewer peaks due to aliasing. The method is applied to five systems with published radial velocity data sets: HD 69830, HD 10180, 55 Cnc, GJ 876 and a simulated very active star. The results are fully compatible with previous analysis, though obtained more straightforwardly. We further show that 55 Cnc e and f could have been respectively detected and suspected in early measurements from the Lick Observatory and Hobby-Eberly Telescope available in 2004, and that frequencies due to dynamical interactions in GJ 876 can be seen.},

  abstract = {Searches for periodicity in time series are often done with models of periodic signals, whose statistical significance is assessed via false alarm probabilities or Bayes factors. However, a statistically significant periodic model might not originate from a strictly periodic source. In astronomy in particular, one expects transient signals that show periodicity for a certain amount of time before vanishing. This situation is encountered for instance in the search for planets in radial velocity data. While planetary signals are expected to have a stable phase, amplitude and frequency - except when strong planet-planet interactions are present - signals induced by stellar activity will typically not exhibit the same stability. In the present article, we explore the use of periodic functions multiplied by time windows to diagnose whether an apparently periodic signal is truly so. We suggest diagnostics to check whether a signal is consistently present in the time series, and has a stable phase, amplitude and period. The tests are expressed both in a periodogram and Bayesian framework. Our methods are applied to the Solar HARPS-N data as well as HD 215152, HD 69830 and HD 13808. We find that (i) the HARPS-N Solar data exhibits signals at the Solar rotation period and its first harmonic (\$\textbackslash sim\$ 13.4 days). The frequency and phase of the 13.4 days signal appear constant within the estimation uncertainties, but its amplitude presents significant variations which can be mapped to activity levels. (ii) as previously reported, we find four, three and two planets orbiting HD 215152, HD 69830 and HD 13808.},

  abstract = {Stellar activity patterns are responsible for jitter effects that are observed at different timescales and amplitudes. These effects are currently in the focus of many exoplanet search projects, since the lack of a well-defined characterization and correction strategy hampers the detection of the signals associated with small exoplanets. Accurate simulations of the stellar photosphere can provide synthetic time series data. These may help to investigate the relation between activity jitter and stellar parameters when considering different active region patterns. Moreover, jitters can be analysed at different wavelength scales in order to design strategies to remove or minimize them. In this work we present the StarSim tool, which is based on a model for a spotted rotating photosphere built from the integration of the spectral contribution of a fine grid of surface elements. The model includes all significant effects affecting the flux intensities and the wavelength of spectral features produced by active regions and planets. A specific application for the characterization and modelling of the spectral signature of active regions is considered, showing that the chromatic effects of faculae are dominant for low temperature contrasts of spots. Synthetic time series are modelled for HD 189733. Our algorithm reproduces both the photometry and the RVs to good precision, generally better than the studies published to date. We evaluate the RV signature of the activity in HD 189733 by exploring a grid of solutions from the photometry. We find that the use of RV data in the inverse problem could break degeneracies and allow for a better determination of some stellar and activity parameters. In addition, the effects of spots are studied for a set of simulated transit photometry, showing that these can introduce variations which are very similar to the signal of an atmosphere dominated by dust.},

  abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling probability density func-tions (combined with abundant computational resources) have transformed the sci-ences, especially in performing probabilistic inferences, or fitting models to data. In this primarily pedagogical contribution, we give a brief overview of the most basic MCMC method and some practical advice for the use of MCMC in real inference problems. We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly con-nects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest. We emphasize that sampling is a method for doing integrals; this guides our thinking about how MCMC output is best used.},

We use a rejection sampling algorithm to study how uncertainty in the observation data manifests in the computed orbital parameters and how this uncertainty depends on the number and spacing of observations. We find that 3 observations equally spaced over at least one half of an orbital period robustly reduces the uncertainty in the semi-major axis and eccentricity to below 10\%. We also study modifications of this revisit strategy in the presence of a central obscuration and show how null observations may still be leveraged to constrain a detected exoplanets orbital parameters. Finally, we suggest a method for incorporating photometric data into the rejection sampling framework to break degeneracy in the orbit fitting procedure and further constrain the orbital parameters.},

  abstract = {Most of our knowledge of planets orbiting nearby stars comes from Doppler surveys. For spaced-based, high-contrast imaging missions, nearby stars with Doppler-discovered planets are attractive targets. The known orbits tell imaging missions where and when to observe, and the dynamically determined masses provide important constraints for the interpretation of planetary spectra. Quantifying the set of planet masses and orbits that could have been detected will enable more efficient planet discovery and characterization. We analyzed Doppler measurements from Lick and Keck Observatories by the California Planet Survey. We focused on stars that are likely targets for three space-based planet imaging mission concepts studied by NASA—WFIRST-AFTA, Exo-C, and Exo-S. The Doppler targets are primarily F8 and later main sequence stars, with observations spanning 1987-2014. We identified 76 stars with Doppler measurements from the prospective mission target lists. We developed an automated planet search and a methodology to estimate the pipeline completeness using injection and recovery tests. We applied this machinery to the Doppler data and computed planet detection limits for each star as a function of planet minimum mass and semimajor axis. For typical stars in the survey, we are sensitive to approximately Saturn-mass planets inside of 1 au, Jupiter-mass planets inside of ∼3 au, and our sensitivity declines out to ∼10 au. For the best Doppler targets, we are sensitive to Neptune-mass planets in 3 au orbits. Using an idealized model of Doppler survey completeness, we forecast the precision of future surveys of non-ideal Doppler targets that are likely targets of imaging missions. Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology. Keck time has been granted by NASA, the University of California, and the University of Hawaii.},

We measured increasing planet occurrence with decreasing planet mass (M). Extrapolation of a power-law mass distribution fitted to our measurements, df/dlogM = 0.39 M-0.48, predicts that 23\% of stars harbor a close-in Earth-mass planet (ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 Earth masses). Theoretical models of planet formation predict a deficit of planets in the domain from 5 to 30 Earth masses and with orbital periods less than 50 days.

We report \textasciitilde\$10\^4\$ planets to be discovered by the TESS primary mission, as well as an additional \$\textbackslash sim 2000\$ planets for each year of the three extended mission scenarios we explored.

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

In this paper, we argue that the current industry standard for such comparisons -- the contrast curve -- falls short of this mandate. We propose a new figure of merit, the "performance map," that incorporates three fundamental concepts in signal detection theory: the true positive fraction (TPF), false positive fraction (FPF), and detection threshold. By supplying a theoretical basis and recipe for generating the performance map, we hope to encourage the widespread adoption of this new metric across subfields in exoplanet imaging.},

For these models, different parameters such as maximum wind speed, a radius of the maximum wind, hurricane shape parameter, hurricane translation speed and the orientation of the trajectory, etc., affect the shape of a hurricane. Hurricanes Lili (2002), Ivan (2004), Katrina (2005), Gustav (2008) and Ike (2008) from the Gulf of Mexico were used for skill assessment. The maximum wind radius was calculated using significant wind radii (R34, R50 and R64) reported by the National Hurricane Center. Different formulas for calculating the radius of maximum wind speed were evaluated. The asymmetric wind field for each hurricane was generated using analytic methods and compared with in situ data from buoys in the Gulf of Mexico and the H*Wind data. Analytical models were able to predict high wind speed under tropical cyclone conditions with relatively high precision. Among the analytical models evaluated in this research, the model proposed by Holland et al. (2010) showed excellent results. Dynamical wind models such as NCEP/NARR provide wind speed with the coarse spatial resolution which is acceptable for far-field locations away from the hurricane eye. In contrast, analytical models were able to produce sufficiently reliable wind speed within a particular radius from the center of the hurricane. Therefore blending of dynamical and analytical models can be used to provide accurate wind data during hurricane passage in the Gulf of Mexico.},

Companions with orbital periods that exceed the duration of the survey manifest in the data as an incomplete orbit or linear trend, a feature that can either present as the sole detectable companion to the host star, or as an additional signal overlain on the signatures of previously discovered companion(s). A diagnostic that can confirm or constrain scenarios in which the trend is caused by an unseen stellar, rather than planetary, companion is the use of high-contrast imaging observations. Here, we present RV data from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search (AAPS) for twenty stars that show evidence of orbiting companions. Of these, six companions have resolved orbits, with three that lie in the planetary regime. Two of these (HD\textasciitilde 92987b and HD\textasciitilde 221420b) are new discoveries. Follow-up observations using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on the Gemini South telescope revealed that five of the twenty monitored companions are likely stellar in nature. We use the sensitivity of the AAPS and DSSI data to place constraints on the mass of the companions for the remaining systems. Our analysis shows that a planetary-mass companion provides the most likely self-consistent explanation of the data for many of the remaining systems.},

The statistics of these occurrence rates have largely been derived from transiting planet discoveries, and have uncovered numerous HZ planets in compact systems around M dwarf host stars. Here we explore the width of the HZ as a function of spectral type, and the dynamical constraints on the number of stable orbits within the HZ for a given star. We show that, although the Hill radius for a given planetary mass increases with larger semi-major axis, the width of the HZ for earlier-type stars allows for more terrestrial planets in the HZ than late-type stars. In general, dynamical constraints allow ∼6 HZ Earth-mass planets for stellar masses \& 0.7M☉, depending on the presence of farther out giant planets. As an example, we consider the case of Beta CVn, a nearby bright solar-type star. We present 20 years of radial velocities (RV) from the Keck/HIRES and APF instruments and conduct an injection-recovery analysis of planetary signatures in the data. Our analysis of these RV data rule out planets more massive than Saturn within 10 AU of the star. These system properties are used to calculate the potential dynamical packing of terrestrial planets in the HZ and show that such nearby stellar targets could be particularly lucrative for HZ planet detection by direct imaging exoplanet missions.},

  abstract = {Radial velocity surveys for extrasolar planets generally require substantial amounts of large telescope time in order to monitor a sufficient number of stars. Two of the aspects which can limit such surveys are the single-object capabilities of the spectrograph, and an inefficient observing strategy for a given observing window. In addition, the detection rate of extrasolar planets using the radial velocity method has thus far been relatively linear with time. With the development of various multi-object Doppler survey instruments, there is growing potential to dramatically increase the detection rate using the Doppler method. Several of these instruments have already begun usage in large-scale surveys for extrasolar planets, such as Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Keck Exoplanet Tracker (ET) on the Sloan 2.5-m wide-field telescope. In order to plan an effective observing strategy for such a program, one must examine the expected results based on a given observing window and target selection. We present simulations of the expected results from a generic multi-object survey based on calculated noise models and sensitivity for the instrument and the known distribution of exoplanetary system parameters. We have developed code for automatically sifting and fitting the planet candidates produced by the survey to allow for fast follow-up observations to be conducted. The techniques presented here may be applied to a wide range of multi-object planet surveys.},

  abstract = {Future, large-scale, exoplanet direct-imaging missions will be capable of discovering and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets. These mission designs can be evaluated using completeness, the fraction of planets from some population that are detectable by a telescope at an arbitrary observation time. However, the original formulation of completeness uses instrument visibility limits and ignores additional integration time and planetary motion constraints. Some of the sampled planets used to calculate completeness may transit in and out of an instrument's geometric and photometric visibility limits while they are being observed, thereby causing the integration time agnostic calculation to overestimate completeness. We present a method for calculating completeness that accounts for the fraction of planets that leave the visibility limits of the telescope during the integration time period. We define completeness using the aggregate fraction of an orbital period during which planets are detectable, calculated using the specific times that planets enter and leave an instrument's visibility limits and the integration time. To perform this calculation, we derive analytical methods for finding the planet-star projected separation extrema, times past periastron that these extrema occur, and times past periastron that the planet-star projected separation intersects a specific separation circle. We also provide efficient numerical methods for calculating the planet-star difference in magnitude extrema and times past periastron corresponding to specific values Δmag. Our integration time adjusted completeness shows that, for a planned star observation at 25 pc with 1-day and 5-day integration times, integration time adjusted completeness of Earth-like planets is reduced by 1\% and 5\% from the integration time agnostic completeness, respectively. Integration time adjusted completeness calculated in this manner also provides a computationally inexpensive method for finding dynamic completeness—the completeness change on subsequent observations.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm, effective over a broad range of planet populations and instruments, for optimizing integration times of an exoplanet direct imaging observation schedule, to maximize the number of unique exoplanet detections under realistic mission constraints. Our planning process uses “completeness” as a reward metric and the nonlinear combination of optimal integration time per target and constant overhead time per target as a cost metric constrained by a total mission time. We validate our planned target list and integration times for a specific telescope by running a Monte Carlo of full mission simulations using EXOSIMS, a code base for simulating telescope survey missions. These simulations encapsulate dynamic details such as time-varying local zodiacal light for each star, planet keep-out regions, exoplanet positions, and strict enforcement of observatory use over time. We test our methods on the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) coronagraphic instrument (CGI). We find that planet, Sun, and solar panel keep-out regions limit some target per-annum visibility to {$<$}28 \% and that the mean local zodiacal light flux for optimally scheduled observations is 22.79 mag arcsec − 2. Both these values are more pessimistic than previous approximations and impact the simulated mission yield. We find that the WFIRST CGI detects 5.48 ± 0.17 and 16.26 ± 0.51 exoplanets, on average, when observing two different planet populations based on Kepler Q1-Q6 data and the full Kepler data release, respectively. Optimizing our planned observations using completeness derived from the more pessimistic planet population (in terms of overall planet occurrence rates) results in a more robust yield than optimization based on the more optimistic planet population. We also find optimization based on the more pessimistic population results in more small planet detections than optimization with the more optimistic population.},

The purpose of the OP is to maximise profits collected from customers in a limited time period, during which all customers cannot be visited. In this paper, we introduce a new type of OP called the multi-profit orienteering problem (MPOP). In the MPOP, each customer vertex has a time-dependent profit such that its value varies on the basis of visiting time. To maximise the total profit, a vehicle should carefully select both the customer vertices and visiting time. We introduce a benchmark problem set for the MPOP and propose a mathematical model and a hybrid heuristic algorithm to solve it. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can solve most of the instances well within a reasonable time.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well-described by the Beta distribution. Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well-described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867+/-0.044 and b = 3.03+/-0.17. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7 times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6 sigma and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

We have previously suggested an empirical scaling relation to predict their amplitudes. This relation has found widespread use but it predicts amplitudes in F-type stars that are higher than observed. Here we present a new scaling relation that is based on the postulate that the power in velocity fluctuations due to p-mode oscillations scales with stellar parameters in the same way as the power in velocity fluctuations due to granulation. The new relation includes a dependence on the damping rate via the mode lifetime and should be testable using observations from the CoRoT and Kepler missions. We also suggest scaling relations for the properties of the background power due to granulation and argue that both these and the amplitude relations should be applicable to red giant stars.},

  abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations δL/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy (δL/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v\_osc\_,\textsubscript{sun}\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be δL/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \&amp; Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., α Cen A and β Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

  abstract = {Statistical experiments, more commonly referred to as Monte Carlo or simulation studies, are used to study the behavior of statistical methods and measures under controlled situations. Whereas recent computing and methodological advances have permitted increased efficiency in the simulation process, known as variance reduction, such experiments remain limited by their finite nature and hence are subject to uncertainty; when a simulation is run more than once, different results are obtained. However, virtually no emphasis has been placed on reporting the uncertainty, referred to here as Monte Carlo error, associated with simulation results in the published literature, or on justifying the number of replications used. These deserve broader consideration. Here we present a series of simple and practical methods for estimating Monte Carlo error as well as determining the number of replications required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The issues and methods are demonstrated with two simple examples, one evaluating operating characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in logistic regression and the other in the context of using the bootstrap to obtain 95\% confidence intervals. The results suggest that in many settings, Monte Carlo error may be more substantial than traditionally thought.},

  abstract = {Future NASA concept missions that are currently under study, like Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) \& Large Ultra-Violet Optical Infra Red (LUVOIR) Surveyor, would discover a large diversity of exoplanets. We propose here a classification scheme that distinguishes exoplanets into different categories based on their size and incident stellar flux, for the purpose of providing the expected number of exoplanets observed (yield) with direct imaging missions. The boundaries of this classification can be computed using the known chemical behavior of gases and condensates at different pressures and temperatures in a planetary atmosphere. In this study, we initially focus on condensation curves for sphalerite ZnS, H2O, CO2 and CH4. The order in which these species condense in a planetary atmosphere define the boundaries between different classes of planets. Broadly, the planets are divided into rocky (0.5 - 1.0RE), super-Earths (1.0- 1.75RE), sub-Neptunes (1.75-3.5RE), sub-Jovians (3.5 - 6.0RE) and Jovians (6-14.3RE) based on their planet sizes, and 'hot', 'warm' and 'cold' based on the incident stellar flux. We then calculate planet occurrence rates within these boundaries for different kinds of exoplanets, \textbackslash eta\_\{planet\}, using the community co-ordinated results of NASA's Exoplanet Program Analysis Group's Science Analysis Group-13 (SAG-13). These occurrence rate estimates are in turn used to estimate the expected exoplanet yields for direct imaging missions of different telescope diameter.},

  abstract = {Most of the exoplanets known today have been discovered by indirect techniques, based on the study of the host star radial velocity or photometric temporal variations. These detections allowed the study of the planet populations in the first 5-8AU from the central stars and have provided precious information on the way planets form and evolve at such separations. Direct imaging on 8-10m class telescopes allows the detection of giant planets at larger separations (currently typically more than 5- 10 AU) complementing the indirect techniques. So far, only a few planets have been imaged around young stars, but each of them provides an opportunity for unique dedicated studies of their orbital, physical and atmospheric properties and sometimes also on the interaction with the 'second-generation', debris discs. These few detections already challenge formation theories. In this paper, I present the results of direct imaging surveys obtained so far, and what they already tell us about giant planet (GP) formation and evolution. Individual and emblematic cases are detailed; they illustrate what future instruments will routinely deliver for a much larger number of stars. I also point out the limitations of this approach, as well as the needs for further work in terms of planet formation modelling. I finally present the progress expected in direct imaging in the near future, thanks in particular to forthcoming planet imagers on 8-10m class telescopes. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

  abstract = {The standard method for solving least squares problems which lead to non-linear normal equations depends upon a reduction of the residuals to linear form by first order Taylor approximations taken about an initial or trial solution for the parameters .2 If the usual least squares procedure, performed with these linear approximations , yields new values for the parameters which are not sufficiently close to the initial values, the neglect of second and higher order terms may invalidate the process, and may actually give rise to a larger value of the sum of the squares of the residuals than that corresponding to the initial solution. This failure of the standard method to improve the initial solution has received some notice in statistical applications of least squares3 and has been encountered rather frequently in connection with certain engineering applications involving the approximate representation of one function by another. The purpose of this article is to show how the problem may be solved by an extension of the standard method which insures improvement of the initial solution.4 The process can also be used for solving non-linear simultaneous equations, in which case it may be considered an extension of Newton's method. Let the function to be approximated be h\{x, y, z, • • •), and let the approximating function be H\{oc, y, z, • • ■ ; a, j3, y, ■ • ■), where a, /3, 7, • ■ ■ are the unknown parameters. Then the residuals at the points, yit zit • • •), i = 1, 2, ■ • • , n, are /,•(«, /3, 7, • • •) = H(xi, yit zit • • • ; a, /3, y, ■ • •)-h(xit yit z,-, • • •), (1) and the least squares criterion requires the minimization of n s(a, 0, 7. and Sci.

  abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is unusual in receiving on-going interest in both industrial and academic circles. Issues such as plant optimization and constrained control which are critical to industrial engineers are naturally embedded in its designs. Model Predictive Control System Design and Implementation Using MATLAB® proposes methods for design and implementation of MPC systems using basis functions that confer the following advantages: • continuous- and discrete-time MPC problems solved in similar design frameworks; • a parsimonious parametric representation of the control trajectory gives rise to computationally efficient algorithms and better on-line performance; and • a more general discrete-time representation of MPC design that becomes identical to the traditional approach for an appropriate choice of parameters. After the theoretical presentation, detailed coverage is given to three industrial applications: a food extruder, a motor and a magnetic bearing system. The subject of quadratic programming, often associated with the core optimization algorithms of MPC is also introduced and explained. The technical contents of this book, mainly based on advances in MPC using state-space models and basis functions – to which the author is a major contributor, will be of interest to control researchers and practitioners, especially of process control. From a pedagogical standpoint, this volume includes numerous simple analytical examples and every chapter contains problems and MATLAB® programs and exercises to assist the student.},

  abstract = {We describe a framework for adaptive astronomical exploration based on iterating an Observation-Inference-Design cycle that allows adjustment of hypotheses and observing protocols in response to the results of observation on-the-fly, as data are gathered. The framework uses a unified Bayesian methodology for the inference and design stages: Bayesian inference to quantify what we have learned from the available data; and Bayesian decision theory to identify which new observations would teach us the most. In the design stage, the utility of possible future observations is determined by how much information they are expected to add to current inferences as measured by the (negative) entropies of the probability distributions involved. Such a Bayesian approach to experimental design dates back to the 1970s, but most existing work focuses on linear models. We use a simple nonlinear problem—planning observations to best determine the orbit of an extrasolar planet—to illustrate the approach and demonstrate that it can significantly improve observing efficiency (i.e., reduce uncertainties at a rate faster than the familiar “root-N” rule) in some situations. We highlight open issues requiring further research, including dependence on model specification, generalizing the utility of an observation (e.g., to include observing “costs”), and computational issues.},

  abstract = {Context. Searching for extrasolar planets through radial velocity measurements relies on the stability of stellar photospheres. Aims. We aim at characterizing the statistical properties of magnetic activity cycles, and studying their impact on spectroscopic measurements such as radial velocities, line bisectors and line shapes. Methods. We use data from the HARPS high-precision planet-search sample comprising 304 FGK stars followed over about 7 years. We obtain high-precision Ca II H\&K chromospheric activity measurements and convert them to R'HK indices using an updated calibration taking into account stellar metallicity. We study R'HK variability as a function of time and search for possible correlations with radial velocities and line shape parameters. Results. We classify stars according to the magnitude and timescale of the Ca II H\&K variability, and identify activity cycles whenever possible. We find that 39+/-8\% of old solar-type stars in the solar neighborhood do not show any activity cycles (or only very weak ones), while 61+/-8\% do have one. Non-cycling stars are almost only found among G dwarfs and at mean activity levels log R'HK {$<$} -4.95. Magnetic cycle amplitude generally decreases with decreasing activity level. A significant fraction of stars exhibit small variations in radial velocities and line shape parameters that are correlated with activity cycles. The sensitivity of radial velocities to magnetic cycles increases towards hotter stars, while late K dwarfs are almost insensitive. Conclusions. Activity cycles do induce long-period, low-amplitude radial velocity variations, at levels up to \textasciitilde 25 m/s. Caution is therefore mandatory when searching for long-period exoplanets. However, these effects can be corrected to high precision by detrending the radial velocity data using simultaneous measurements of Ca II H\&K flux and line shape parameters. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {Radial velocity (RV) detection of planets is hampered by astrophysical processes on the surfaces of stars that induce a stochastic signal, or “jitter,” which can drown out or even mimic planetary signals. Here, we empirically and carefully measure the RV jitter of more than 600 stars from the California Planet Search sample on a star by star basis. As part of this process, we explore the activity–RV correlation of stellar cycles and include appendices listing every ostensibly companion-induced signal we removed and every activity cycle we noted. We then use precise stellar properties from Brewer et al. to separate the sample into bins of stellar mass and examine trends with activity and with evolutionary state. We find that RV jitter tracks stellar evolution and that in general, stars evolve through different stages of RV jitter: the jitter in younger stars is driven by magnetic activity, while the jitter in older stars is convectively driven and dominated by granulation and oscillations. We identify the “jitter minimum”—where activity-driven and convectively driven jitter have similar amplitudes—for stars between 0.7 and 1.7 M⊙ and find that more-massive stars reach this jitter minimum later in their lifetime, in the subgiant or even giant phases. Finally, we comment on how these results can inform future RV efforts, from prioritization of follow-up targets from transit surveys like TESS to target selection of future RV surveys.},

  abstract = {The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a challenging problem in combinatorial optimization. In this paper we consider the multiobjective TSP for which the aim is to obtain or to approximate the set of efficient solutions. In a first step, we classify and describe briefly the existing works, that are essentially based on the use of metaheuristics. In a second step, we propose a new method, called two-phase Pareto local search. In the first phase of this method, an initial population composed of an approximation to the extreme supported efficient solutions is generated. The second phase is a Pareto local search applied to all solutions of the initial population. The method does not use any numerical parameter. We show that using the combination of these two techniques-good initial population generation and Pareto local search-gives, on the majority of the instances tested, better results than state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {Direct imaging of Jupiter-like exoplanets around young stars provides a glimpse into how our solar system formed. The brightness of young stars requires the use of next-generation devices such as the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). Using the GPI, Macintosh et al. discovered a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a young star, 51 Eridani (see the Perspective by Mawet). The planet, 51 Eri b, has a methane signature and is probably the smallest exoplanet that has been directly imaged. These findings open the door to understanding solar system origins and herald the dawn of a new era in next-generation planetary imaging. Science , this issue p. [64][1]; see also p. [39][2] Directly detecting thermal emission from young extrasolar planets allows measurement of their atmospheric compositions and luminosities, which are influenced by their formation mechanisms. Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the \textasciitilde 20-million-year-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13 astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with strong methane and water-vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and photometry yields a luminosity (normalized by the luminosity of the Sun) of 1.6 to 4.0 × 10−6 and an effective temperature of 600 to 750 kelvin. For this age and luminosity, “hot-start” formation models indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the “cold-start” core-accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.

  abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

Our catalog provides a baseline for comparison of exoplanet observations to 19 bodies in our own Solar System, which can assist in the prioritization of exoplanets for time-intensive follow-up with next-generation Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) and space-based direct observation missions. Using high and low-resolution spectra of these Solar System objects, we also derive colors for these bodies and explore how a color-color diagram could be used to initially distinguish between rocky, icy, and gaseous exoplanets. We explore how the colors of Solar System analog bodies would change when orbiting different host stars. This catalog of Solar System reference spectra and albedos is available for download through the Carl Sagan Institute.},

  abstract = {In long adaptive optics corrected exposures, exoplanet detections are currently limited by speckle noise originating from the telescope and instrument optics, and it is expected that such noise will also limit future high-contrast imaging instruments for both ground and space-based telescopes. Previous theoretical analysis have shown that the time intensity variations of a single speckle follows a modified Rician. It is first demonstrated here that for a circular pupil this temporal intensity distribution also represents the speckle spatial intensity distribution at a fix separation from the point spread function center; this fact is demonstrated using numerical simulations for coronagraphic and non-coronagraphic data. The real statistical distribution of the noise needs to be taken into account explicitly when selecting a detection threshold appropriate for some desired confidence level. In this paper, a technique is described to obtain the pixel intensity distribution of an image and its corresponding confidence level as a function of the detection threshold. Using numerical simulations, it is shown that in the presence of speckles noise, a detection threshold up to three times higher is required to obtain a confidence level equivalent to that at 5sigma for Gaussian noise. The technique is then tested using TRIDENT CFHT and angular differential imaging NIRI Gemini adaptive optics data. It is found that the angular differential imaging technique produces quasi-Gaussian residuals, a remarkable result compared to classical adaptive optic imaging. A power-law is finally derived to predict the 1-3*10\^-7 confidence level detection threshold when averaging a partially correlated non-Gaussian noise.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review the impact of small sample statistics on detection thresholds and corresponding confidence levels (CLs) in high-contrast imaging at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution elements decreases rapidly toward small angles. This reduction of the number of degrees of freedom dramatically affects CLs and false alarm probabilities. Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations, which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at fixed CL. The statistical penalty exponentially increases toward very small inner working angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm probabilities can be significantly higher than expected. Here we present a rigorous statistical analysis that ensures robustness of the CL, but also imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits (thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical effect has a significant impact on current coronagraphic and future high-contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging planet surveys. © 2014.

  abstract = {Forty-seven nearby main-sequence stars were surveyed with the Keck Interferometer mid-infrared Nulling instrument (KIN) between 2008 and 2011, searching for faint resolved emission from exozodiacal dust. Observations of a subset of the sample have already been reported, focusing essentially on stars with no previously known dust. Here we extend this previous analysis to the whole KIN sample, including 22 more stars with known near- and/or far-infrared excesses. In addition to an analysis similar to that of the first paper of this series, which was restricted to the 8–9 μm spectral region, we present measurements obtained in all 10 spectral channels covering the 8–13 μm instrumental bandwidth. Based on the 8–9 μm data alone, which provide the highest signal-to-noise measurements, only one star shows a large excess imputable to dust emission (η Crv), while four more show a significant ({$>$}3σ) excess: β Leo, β UMa, ζ Lep, and γ Oph. Overall, excesses detected by KIN are more frequent around A-type stars than later spectral types. A statistical analysis of the measurements further indicates that stars with known far-infrared (λ ⩾ 70 μm) excesses have higher exozodiacal emission levels than stars with no previous indication of a cold outer disk. This statistical trend is observed regardless of spectral type and points to a dynamical connection between the inner (zodi-like) and outer (Kuiper-Belt-like) dust populations. The measured levels for such stars are clustering close to the KIN detection limit of a few hundred zodis and are indeed consistent with those expected from a population of dust that migrated in from the outer belt by Poynting–Robertson drag. Conversely, no significant mid-infrared excess is found around sources with previously reported near-infrared resolved excesses, which typically have levels of the order of 1\% over the photospheric flux. If dust emission is really at play in these near-infrared detections, the absence of a strong mid-infrared counterpart points to populations of very hot and small (submicron) grains piling up very close to the sublimation radius. For solar-type stars with no known infrared excess, likely to be the most relevant targets for a future exo-Earth direct imaging mission, we find that their median zodi level is 12 ± 24 zodis and lower than 60 (90) zodis with 95\% (99\%) confidence, if a lognormal zodi luminosity distribution is assumed.},

  abstract = {The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will be the first high-performance stellar coronagraph using active wavefront control for deep starlight suppression in space, providing unprecedented levels of contrast, spatial resolution, and sensitivity for astronomical observations in the optical. One science case enabled by the CGI will be taking images and(R\textasciitilde 50)spectra of faint interplanetary dust structures present in the habitable zone of nearby sunlike stars (\textasciitilde 10 pc) and within the snow-line of more distant ones(\textasciitilde 20pc), down to dust density levels commensurate with that of the solar system zodiacal cloud. Reaching contrast levels below\textasciitilde 10-7 for the first time, CGI will cross an important threshold in debris disks physics, accessing disks with low enough optical depths that their structure is dominated by transport phenomena than collisions. Hence, CGI results will be crucial for determining how exozodiacal dust grains are produced and transported in low-density disks around mature stars. Additionally, CGI will be able to measure the brightness level and constrain the degree of asymmetry of exozodiacal clouds around individual nearby sunlike stars in the optical, at the \textasciitilde 10x solar zodiacal emission level. This information will be extremely valuable for optimizing the observational strategy of possible future exo-Earth direct imaging missions, especially those planning to operate at optical wavelengths, such as Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR).},

  abstract = {With the broad interest in and development of superhydrophobic surfaces for self-cleaning, condensation heat transfer enhancement and anti-icing applications, more detailed insights on droplet interactions on these surfaces have emerged. Specifically, when two droplets coalesce, they can spontaneously jump away from a superhydrophobic surface due to the release of excess surface energy. Here we show that jumping droplets gain a net positive charge that causes them to repel each other mid-flight. We used electric fields to quantify the charge on the droplets and identified the mechanism for the charge accumulation, which is associated with the formation of the electric double layer at the droplet–surface interface. The observation of droplet charge accumulation provides insight into jumping droplet physics as well as processes involving charged liquid droplets. Furthermore, this work is a starting point for more advanced approaches for enhancing jumping droplet surface performance by using external electric fields to control droplet jumping.}

EXOSIMS is an open-source simulation tool for parametric modeling of the detection yield and characterization of exoplanets. EXOSIMS has been adopted by the Exoplanet Exploration Programs Standards Definition and Evaluation Team (ExSDET) as a common mechanism for comparison of exoplanet mission concept studies. To ensure trustworthiness of the tool, we developed a validation test plan that leverages the Python-language unit-test framework, utilizes integration tests for selected module interactions, and performs end-to-end crossvalidation with other yield tools. This paper presents the test methods and results, with the physics-based tests such as photometry and integration time calculation treated in detail and the functional tests treated summarily. The test case utilized a 4m unobscured telescope with an idealized coronagraph and an exoplanet population from the IPAC radial velocity (RV) exoplanet catalog. The known RV planets were set at quadrature to allow deterministic validation of the calculation of physical parameters, such as working angle, photon counts and integration time. The observing keepout region was tested by generating plots and movies of the targets and the keepout zone over a year. Although the keepout integration test required the interpretation of a user, the test revealed problems in the L2 halo orbit and the parameterization of keepout applied to some solar system bodies, which the development team was able to address. The validation testing of EXOSIMS was performed iteratively with the developers of EXOSIMS and resulted in a more robust, stable, and trustworthy tool that the exoplanet community can use to simulate exoplanet direct-detection missions from probe class, to WFIRST, up to large mission concepts such as HabEx and LUVOIR.},

  abstract = {The Astro2020 Decadal Survey recommended as the next strategic astrophysics mission a 6 m class space telescope capable of high-contrast direct imaging of Earth-size exoplanets in about one hundred habitable zones of nearby sun-like stars. The expected number of imageable exoplanets for such a telescope depends on the architecture and the metrics used to evaluate those architectures. In this paper, we assess the yield of notional coronagraph-only, starshade-only, and hybrid starshade/coronagraph architectures for several metrics. We evaluate the exoplanet yield for a 20\% bandwidth, SNR=5, R=70 water search metric; a 20\% bandwidth, SNR=8.5, R=140 oxygen search metric; and a 4x20\% bandwidth metric, SNR=8.5, R=7 for 450-700 nm and R=140 for 700-1000 nm, which is tailored for a coronagraph’s sequence of 20\% bandwidth sub-spectra. We bound the number of expected exoplanets by considering three cases of a priori knowledge: the case of no prior knowledge that requires a photometric blind search for exoplanets; the theoretical case of perfect prior knowledge that skips the photometric blind search and performs only spectral characterizations using realistic mission scheduling constraints (this approach shows the upper bound and when target exhaustion is reached); and a case of partial prior knowledge via a hypothetical, future extreme precision radial velocity instrument with 3 cm/s sensitivity. This work is an initial study of the potential exoplanet science return for the Decadal-recommended large infrared/optical/UV Great Observatory (IROUV).},

We detail a modeling framework that performs dynamically responsive observation scheduling with realistic mission constraints. We evaluate exo-Earth yields against three metrics of spectral characterization for the four mission architectures and three levels of prior knowledge (none, partial, and perfect). The EPRV provided prior knowledge increases yields by ∼30 \% and accelerates by a factor of 3 to 6 the time to achieve half of the yield of the mission. Prior knowledge makes all the mission architectures more nimble and powerful, and most especially starshade-based architectures. With prior knowledge, a small telescope with a starshade can achieve comparable yield to a larger telescope with a coronagraph.},

  abstract = {We know now from radial velocity surveys and transit space missions that planets only a few times more massive than our Earth are frequent around solar-type stars. Fundamental questions about their formation history, physical properties, internal structure, and atmosphere composition are, however, still to be solved. We present here the detection of a system of four low-mass planets around the bright (V = 5.5) and close-by (6.5 pc) star HD 219134. This is the first result of the Rocky Planet Search programme with HARPS-N on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma. The inner planet orbits the star in 3.0935 ± 0.0003 days, on a quasi-circular orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.0382 ± 0.0003 AU. Spitzer observations allowed us to detect the transit of the planet in front of the star making HD 219134 b the nearest known transiting planet to date. From the amplitude of the radial velocity variation (2.25 ± 0.22 ms\textsuperscript{-1}) and observed depth of the transit (359 ± 38 ppm), the planet mass and radius are estimated to be 4.36 ± 0.44 M\textsubscript{⊕} and 1.606 ± 0.086 R\textsubscript{⊕}, leading to a mean density of 5.76 ± 1.09 g cm\textsuperscript{-3}, suggesting a rocky composition. One additional planet with minimum-mass of 2.78 ± 0.65 M\textsubscript{⊕} moves on a close-in, quasi-circular orbit with a period of 6.767 ± 0.004 days. The third planet in the system has a period of 46.66 ± 0.08 days and a minimum-mass of 8.94 ± 1.13 M\textsubscript{⊕}, at 0.233 ± 0.002 AU from the star. Its eccentricity is 0.46 ± 0.11. The period of this planet is close to the rotational period of the star estimated from variations of activity indicators (42.3 ± 0.1 days). The planetary origin of the signal is, however, thepreferred solution as no indication of variation at the corresponding frequency is observed for activity-sensitive parameters. Finally, a fourth additional longer-period planet of mass of 71 M\textsubscript{⊕} orbits the star in 1842 days, on an eccentric orbit (e = 0.34 ± 0.17) at a distance of 2.56 AU. {$<$}P /{$>$}The photometric time series and radial velocities used in this work are available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/584/A72"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/584/A72{$<$}/A{$>$}},

In this paper, we present an extension of classic OP—Orienteering Problem with Functional Profits (OPFP), where the score of a specific point depends on its characteristics, position in the route, and other points in the route. For solving OPFP, we developed an open-source framework for solving orienteering problems, which utilizes four core components of OP in its modular architecture. Fully-written in Go programming language our framework can be extended for solving different types of tasks with different algorithms; this was demonstrated by implementation of two popular algorithms for OP solving—Ant Colony Optimization and Recursive Greedy Algorithm. Computational efficiency of the framework was shown through solving four well-known OP types: classic Orienteering Problem (OP), Orienteering Problem with Compulsory Vertices (OPCV), Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW), and Time Dependent Orienteering Problem (TDOP) along with OPFP. Experiments were conducted on a large multi-source dataset for Saint Petersburg, Russia, containing data from Instagram, TripAdvisor, Foursquare and official touristic website. Our framework is able to construct touristic paths for different OP types within few seconds using dataset with thousands of points of interest.},

  abstract = {The Kepler survey provides a statistical census of planetary systems out to the habitable zone. Because most planets are non-transiting, orbital architectures are best estimated using simulated observations of ensemble populations. Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet systems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at least 42\% of Sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with seven or more exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au could be as high as 100\% depending on assumptions about the distribution of single transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars of η ⊕ = 36 ± 14\%. The innermost planets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10 days (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge, or which could be explained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary systems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than ≈8\% and ≈3\% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus, respectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a typical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known exoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone exoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital periods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to optimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future direct imaging missions.},

  abstract = {In a naive approach to the theory of dynamical systems on Euclidean space Rn, one might hope to obtain a complete classification of all systems, starting with the very simplest types and gradually building up an understanding of more complicated ones. The difficulties that one encounters, even at the linear stage underline the complexity and richness of the theory of dynamical systems, and this is part of its attraction. They also indicate the need for a less ambitious approach to the whole classification problem. Instead of aiming at a complete solution, this chapter attempts to classify a “suitably large” class of dynamical systems. This chapter begins with a review of linear systems on Rn. The bulk of the chapter, however, deals with stable linear systems on a general Banach space. For this, a certain amount of spectral theory is needed that is included in an appendix to the chapter. The material of Rn provides a background of concrete examples against, which the more general results on Banach spaces may be tested and placed in perspective. © 1980, Academic Press Inc.},

  abstract = {This book provides an introduction to the basic principles and tools for the design and analysis of feedback systems. It is intended to serve a diverse audience of scientists and engineers who are interested in understanding and utilizing feedback in physical, biological, information and social systems.We have attempted to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum while being careful not to sacrifice rigor in the process. We have also attempted to make use of examples from a variety of disciplines, illustrating the generality of many of the tools while at the same time showing how they can be applied in specific application domains. A major goal of this book is to present a concise and insightful view of the current knowledge in feedback and control systems. The field of control started by teaching everything that was known at the time and, as new knowledge was acquired, additional courses were developed to cover new techniques. A consequence of this evolution is that introductory courses have remained the same for many years, and it is often necessary to take many individual courses in order to obtain a good perspective on the field. In developing this book, we have attempted to condense the current knowledge by emphasizing fundamental concepts. We believe that it is important to understand why feedback is useful, to know the language and basic mathematics of control and to grasp the key paradigms that have been developed over the past half century. It is also important to be able to solve simple feedback problems using back-of-the-envelope techniques, to recognize fundamental limitations and difficult control problems and to have a feel for available design methods. This book was originally developed for use in an experimental course at Caltech involving students from a wide set of backgrounds. The course was offered to undergraduates at the junior and senior levels in traditional engineering disciplines, as well as first- and second-year graduate students in engineering and science. This latter group included graduate students in biology, computer science and physics. Over the course of several years, the text has been classroom tested at Caltech and at Lund University, and the feedback from many students and colleagues has been incorporated to help improve the readability and accessibility of the material. Because of its intended audience, this book is organized in a slightly unusual fashion compared to many other books on feedback and control. In particular, we introduce a number of concepts in the text that are normally reserved for second-year courses on control and hence often not available to students who are not control systems majors. This has been done at the expense of certain traditional topics, which we felt that the astute student could learn independently and are often explored through the exercises. Examples of topics that we have included are nonlinear dynamics, Lyapunov stability analysis, the matrix exponential, reachability and observability, and fundamental limits of performance and robustness. Topics that we have deemphasized include root locus techniques, lead/lag compensation and detailed rules for generating Bode and Nyquist plots by hand. Several features of the book are designed to facilitate its dual function as a basic engineering text and as an introduction for researchers in natural, information and social sciences. The bulk of the material is intended to be used regardless of the audience and covers the core principles and tools in the analysis and design of feedback systems. Advanced sections, marked by the â€œdangerous bendâ€� symbol shown here, contain material that requires a slightly more technical background, of the sort that would be expected of senior undergraduates in engineering. A few sections are marked by two dangerous bend symbols and are intended for readers with more specialized backgrounds, identified at the beginning of the section. To limit the length of the text, several standard results and extensions are given in the exercises, with appropriate hints toward their solutions. To further augment the printed material contained here, a companion web site has been developed and is available from the publisherâ€™s web page: http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8701.html The web site contains a database of frequently asked questions, supplemental examples and exercises, and lecture material for courses based on this text. The material is organized by chapter and includes a summary of the major points in the text as well as links to external resources. The web site also contains the source code for many examples in the book, as well as utilities to implement the techniques described in the text. Most of the code was originally written using MATLAB M-files but was also tested with LabView MathScript to ensure compatibility with both packages. Many files can also be run using other scripting languages such as Octave, SciLab, SysQuake and Xmath. The first half of the book focuses almost exclusively on state space control systems. We begin in Chapter 2 with a description of modeling of physical, biological and information systems using ordinary differential equations and difference equations. Chapter 3 presents a number of examples in some detail, primarily as a reference for problems that will be used throughout the text. Following this, Chapter 4 looks at the dynamic behavior of models, including definitions of stability and more complicated nonlinear behavior. We provide advanced sections in this chapter on Lyapunov stability analysis because we find that it is useful in a broad array of applications and is frequently a topic that is not introduced until later in oneâ€™s studies. The remaining three chapters of the first half of the book focus on linear systems, beginning with a description of input/output behavior in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, we formally introduce feedback systems by demonstrating how state space control laws can be designed. This is followed in Chapter 7 by material on output feedback and estimators. Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the key concepts of reachability and observability, which give tremendous insight into the choice of actuators and sensors, whether for engineered or natural systems. The second half of the book presents material that is often considered to be from the field of â€œclassical control.â€� This includes the transfer function, introduced in Chapter 8, which is a fundamental tool for understanding feedback systems. Using transfer functions, one can begin to analyze the stability of feedback systems using frequency domain analysis, including the ability to reason about the closed loop behavior of a system from its open loop characteristics. This is the subject of Chapter 9, which revolves around the Nyquist stability criterion. In Chapters 10 and 11, we again look at the design problem, focusing first on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and then on the more general process of loop shaping. PID control is by far the most common design technique in control systems and a useful tool for any student. The chapter on frequency domain design introduces many of the ideas of modern control theory, including the sensitivity function. In Chapter 12, we combine the results from the second half of the book to analyze some of the fundamental trade-offs between robustness and performance. This is also a key chapter illustrating the power of the techniques that have been developed and serving as an introduction for more advanced studies. The book is designed for use in a 10- to 15-week course in feedback systems that provides many of the key concepts needed in a variety of disciplines. For a 10-week course, Chapters 1â€“2, 4â€“6 and 8â€“11 can each be covered in a weekâ€™s time, with the omission of some topics from the final chapters. A more leisurely course, spread out over 14â€“15 weeks, could cover the entire book, with 2 weeks on modeling (Chapters 2 and 3) â€” particularly for students without much background in ordinary differential equations â€” and 2 weeks on robust performance (Chapter 12). The mathematical prerequisites for the book are modest and in keeping with our goal of providing an introduction that serves a broad audience. We assume familiarity with the basic tools of linear algebra, including matrices, vectors and eigenvalues. These are typically covered in a sophomore-level course on the subject, and the textbooks by Apostol [10], Arnold [13] and Strang [187] can serve as good references. Similarly, we assume basic knowledge of differential equations, including the concepts of homogeneous and particular solutions for linear ordinary differential equations in one variable. Apostol [10] and Boyce and DiPrima [42] cover this material well. Finally, we also make use of complex numbers and functions and, in some of the advanced sections, more detailed concepts in complex variables that are typically covered in a junior-level engineering or physics course in mathematical methods. Apostol [9] or Stewart [186] can be used for the basic material, with Ahlfors [6], Marsden and Hoffman [146] or Saff and Snider [172] being good references for the more advanced material. We have chosen not to include appendices summarizing these various topics since there are a number of good books available. One additional choice that we felt was important was the decision not to rely on a knowledge of Laplace transforms in the book. While their use is by far the most common approach to teaching feedback systems in engineering, many students in the natural and information sciences may lack the necessary mathematical background. Since Laplace transforms are not required in any essential way, we have included them only in an advanced section intended to tie things together for students with that background. Of course, we make tremendous use of transfer functions, which we introduce through the notion of response to exponential inputs,},

Each job j has a positive handling time h (j), a time window [r (j), d (j)], and a benefit b (j). We consider the following two problems: MAX-VSP asks to find a schedule for a single vehicle to process a subset of jobs with the maximum benefit; and MIN-VSP asks to find a schedule to process all given jobs with the minimum number of vehicles. We first give an O (ρ n3 + γ) time algorithm that delivers a 2-approximate solution to MAX-VSP, where ρ = maxj, j′ (d (j) - r (j)) / h (j′) and γ is the maximum number of jobs that can be processed by the vehicle after processing a job j and before visiting the processed job j again by deadline d (j). We then present an O (ρ n4 + γ) time algorithm that delivers a 2 H (n)-approximate solution to MIN-VSP, where H (n) is the nth harmonic number. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) is a diffraction suppression system installed in the recently deployed instruments Palomar/P1640, Gemini/GPI, and VLT/SPHERE to allow direct imaging and spectroscopy of circumstellar environments. Using a prolate apodization, the current implementations offer raw contrasts down to 10 at 0.2 arcsec from a star over a wide bandpass (20\%), in the presence of central obstruction and struts, enabling the study of young or massive gaseous planets. Observations of older or lighter companions at smaller separations would require improvements in terms of the inner working angle (IWA) and contrast, but the methods originally used for these designs were not able to fully explore the parameter space.We propose a novel approach to improve the APLC performance. Our method relies on the linear properties of the coronagraphic electric field with the apodization at any wavelength to develop numerical solutions producing coronagraphic star images with high-contrast region in broadband light. We explore the parameter space by considering different aperture geometries, contrast levels, dark-zone sizes, bandpasses, and focal plane mask sizes. We present an application of these solutions to the case of Gemini/GPI with a design delivering a 10 raw contrast at 0.19 arcsec and offering a significantly reduced sensitivity to low-order aberrations compared to the current implementation. Optimal solutions have also been found to reach 10 contrast in broadband light regardless of the aperture shape, with effective IWA in the 2-3.5 λ/D range, therefore making the APLC a suitable option for the future exoplanet direct imagers on the ground or in space.},

  abstract = {The coronagraph instrument in the WFIRST-AFTA mission will allow high contrast imaging of exoplanetary systems with the benefit of a 2.4 meter space telescope. The instrument will feature an integral field spectrograph (IFS) capable of measuring spectra from exoplanets. Since the typical exoplanet target will be dimmer than the host star by a factor of \textasciitilde 1e9, and the dispersion of this light into many spectral channels further suppresses the photon rate, the noise requirements on the detector for this instrument will be very tight. From a performance perspective, many parameters are important, including the read noise, the dark current, and the clock induced charge. At the same time, from a functionality perspective, the unique challenges of the space environment, in particular damage from high energy cosmic rays, need to be assessed and mitigated. In this paper we present our recent work in selecting the detector for the WFIRST-AFTA IFS. We also discuss flight operation considerations and risks associated with these detectors as well as their technology readiness level.},

  abstract = {Direct detection and characterization of extrasolar planets has become possible with powerful new coronagraphs on ground-based telescopes. Space telescopes with active optics and coronagraphs will expand the frontier to imaging Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of nearby Sun-like stars. Currently, NASA is studying potential space missions to detect and characterize such planets, which are dimmer than their host stars by a factor of 1010. One approach is to use a star-shade occulter. Another is to use an internal coronagraph. The advantages of a coronagraph are its greater targeting versatility and higher technology readiness, but one disadvantage is its need for an ultrastable wavefront when operated open-loop. Achieving this requires a system-engineering approach, which specifies and designs the telescope and coronagraph as an integrated system. We describe a systems engineering process for deriving a wavefront stability error budget for any potential telescope/coronagraph combination. The first step is to calculate a given coronagraph’s basic performance metrics, such as contrast. The second step is to calculate the sensitivity of that coronagraph’s performance to its telescope’s wavefront stability. The utility of the method is demonstrated by intercomparing the ability of several monolithic and segmented telescope and coronagraph combinations to detect an exo-Earth at 10 pc.},

  abstract = {The WFIRST coronagraph, currently in the design phase, will make possible for the first time the direct imaging of exoplanets down to Jupiters. The main technical challenge in direct detection comes from three areas: starlight suppression, low flux detection, and speckle stabilization in the dark zone where the planet or disk light is to be detected. These three aspects in turn place requirements on key instrument parameters such as system throughput, raw contrast and detector effects. The link between instrument limitations and instrument performance is captured in models, and balanced using error budgets. Instrument performance can be measured in terms of the science yield, which is itself limited by available mission time and the instrument sensitivity floor. In this paper, we present an overview of the modeling and methodology to assess the sensitivity of the coronagraph and some of the key results pertaining to the WFIRST coronagraph.},

  abstract = {We have carried out high contrast imaging of 70 young, nearby B and A stars to search for brown dwarf and planetary companions as part of the Gemini NICI Planet-Finding Campaign. Our survey represents the largest, deepest survey for planets around high-mass stars (≈1.5-2.5 M ⊙) conducted to date and includes the planet hosts β Pic and Fomalhaut. We obtained follow-up astrometry of all candidate companions within 400 AU projected separation for stars in uncrowded fields and identified new low-mass companions to HD 1160 and HIP 79797. We have found that the previously known young brown dwarf companion to HIP 79797 is itself a tight (3 AU) binary, composed of brown dwarfs with masses 58\^\{+21\}\_\{-20\} M Jup and 55\^\{+20\}\_\{-19\} M Jup, making this system one of the rare substellar binaries in orbit around a star. Considering the contrast limits of our NICI data and the fact that we did not detect any planets, we use high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations to show that fewer than 20\% of 2 M ⊙ stars can have giant planets greater than 4 M Jup between 59 and 460 AU at 95\% confidence, and fewer than 10\% of these stars can have a planet more massive than 10 M Jup between 38 and 650 AU. Overall, we find that large-separation giant planets are not common around B and A stars: fewer than 10\% of B and A stars can have an analog to the HR 8799 b (7 M Jup, 68 AU) planet at 95\% confidence. We also describe a new Bayesian technique for determining the ages of field B and A stars from photometry and theoretical isochrones. Our method produces more plausible ages for high-mass stars than previous age-dating techniques, which tend to underestimate stellar ages and their uncertainties.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the Namib Desert fog represents an alternative water source. This is utilised by Darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) that employ different strategies for obtaining the fog water. Some dig trenches in the sand, while others use their own bodies as fog collectors assuming a characteristic fog-basking stance. Two beetle species from the genus Onymacris have been observed to fog-bask on the ridges of the sand dunes. These beetles all have smooth elytra surfaces, while another species with elytra covered in bumps is reported to have specialised adaptations facilitating water capture by fog-basking. To resolve if these other beetles also fog-bask, and if an elytra covered in bumps is a more efficient fog water collector than a smooth one, we examined four Namib Desert beetles; the smooth Onymacris unguicularis and O. laeviceps and the bumpy Stenocara gracilipes and Physasterna cribripes. Here we describe the beetles' fog-basking behaviour, the details of their elytra structures, and determine how efficient their dorsal surface areas are at harvesting water from fog. RESULTS: The beetles differ greatly in size. The largest P. cribripes has a dorsal surface area that is 1.39, 1.56, and 2.52 times larger than O. unguicularis, O. laeviceps, and S. gracilipes, respectively. In accordance with earlier reports, we found that the second largest O. unguicularis is the only one of the four beetles that assumes the head standing fog-basking behaviour, and that fog is necessary to trigger this behaviour. No differences were seen in the absolute amounts of fog water collected on the dorsal surface areas of the different beetles. However, data corrected according to the sizes of the beetles revealed differences. The better fog water harvesters were S. gracilipes and O. unguicularis while the large P. cribripes was the poorest. Examination of the elytra microstructures showed clear structural differences, but the elytra of all beetles were found to be completely hydrophobic. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in fog water harvesting efficiency by the dorsal surface areas of beetles with very different elytra surface structures were minor. We therefore conclude that the fog-basking behaviour itself is a more important factor than structural adaptations when O. unguicularis collect water from fog.}

  abstract = {Rotation periods are reported for 14 main-sequence stars, bringing the total number of such stars with well determined rotation periods to 41. It is found that the mean level of their Ca II H and K emission (averaged over 15 years) is correlated with rotation period, as expected. However, there is a further dependence of the emission on spectral type. When expressed as the ratio of chromospheric flux to total bolometric flux, the emission is well correlated with the parameter P(obs)/tau(c), where P(obs) is the observed rotation period and tau(c)(B - V) is a theoretically-derived convective overturn time, calculated assuming a mixing length to scale height ratio alpha of about 2. This finding is consonant with general predictions of dynamo theory, if the relation between chromospheric emission and dynamo-generated magnetic fields is essentially independent of rotation rate and spectral type for the stars considered. The dependence of mean chromospheric emission on rotation and spectral type is essentially the same for stars above and below the Vaughan-Preston (1980) 'gap', thus casting doubt on explanations of the gap in terms of a discontinuity in dynamo characteristics.},

Applications span a wide range, from packing problems in geometry to characterization of molecular states in statistical physics. BH is seeing a reemergence in computational structural biology due to its ability to obtain a coarse-grained representation of the protein energy surface in terms of local minima. In this paper, we show that the BH framework is general and versatile, allowing to address problems related to the characterization of protein structure, assembly, and motion due to its fundamental ability to sample minima in a high-dimensional variable space. We show how specific implementations of the main components in BH yield algorithmic realizations that attain state-of-the-art results in the context of ab initio protein structure prediction and rigid protein-protein docking. We also show that BH can map intermediate minima related with motions connecting diverse stable functionally relevant states in a protein molecule, thus serving as a first step towards the characterization of transition trajectories connecting these states.},

  abstract = {Context. ESPRESSO is the new high-resolution spectrograph of ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT).It was designed for ultra-high radial-velocity (RV) precision and extreme spectral fidelity with the aim of performing exoplanet research and fundamental astrophysical experiments with unprecedentedprecision and accuracy. It is able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UTs) of the VLTat a spectral resolving power of 140 000 or 190 000 over the 378.2 to 788.7 nm wavelength range; itcan also observe with all four UTs together, turning the VLT into a 16 m diameter equivalent telescope in terms of collecting area while still providing a resolving power of 70 000. Aims. We providea general description of the ESPRESSO instrument, report on its on-sky performance, and present ourGuaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program along with its first results. Methods. ESPRESSO was installed on the Paranal Observatory in fall 2017. Commissioning (on-sky testing) was conducted between December 2017 and September 2018. The instrument saw its official start of operations on October 1,2018, but improvements to the instrument and recommissioning runs were conducted until July 2019. Results. The measured overall optical throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65″ exceeds the 10\% mark under nominal astroclimatic conditions. We demonstrate an RV precision of better than 25 cm s-1 during a single night and 50 cm s-1 over several months. These values being limited by photon noise and stellar jitter shows that the performance is compatiblewith an instrumental precision of 10 cm s-1. No difference has been measured across the UTs, neither in throughput nor RV precision. Conclusions. The combination of the large collecting telescope area with the efficiency and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO opens a new parameter space in RV measurements, the study of planetary atmospheres, fundamental constants, stellar characterization, and many other fields.},

  abstract = {EarthFinder is a NASA Astrophysics Probe mission concept selected for study as input to the 2020 Astrophysics National Academies Decadal Survey. The EarthFinder concept is based on a dramatic shift in our understanding of how PRV measurements should be made. We propose a new paradigm which brings the high precision, high cadence domain of transit photometry as demonstrated by Kepler and TESS to the challenges of PRV measurements at the cm/s level. This new paradigm takes advantage of: 1) broad wavelength coverage from the UV to NIR which is only possible from space to minimize the effects of stellar activity; 2) extremely compact, highly stable, highly efficient spectrometers (R{$>$}150,000) which require the diffraction-limited imaging possible only from space over a broad wavelength range; 3) the revolution in laser-based wavelength standards to ensure cm/s precision over many years; 4) a high cadence observing program which minimizes sampling-induced period aliases; 5) exploiting the absolute flux stability from space for continuum normalization for unprecedented line-by-line analysis not possible from the ground; and 6) focusing on the bright stars which will be the targets of future imaging missions so that EarthFinder can use a \textasciitilde 1.5 m telescope.},

  abstract = {[Abridged] The Study Analysis Group 8 of the NASA Exoplanet Analysis Group was convened to assess the current capabilities and the future potential of the precise radial velocity (PRV) method to advance the NASA goal to "search for planetary bodies and Earth-like planets in orbit around other stars.: (U.S. National Space Policy, June 28, 2010). PRVs complement other exoplanet detection methods, for example offering a direct path to obtaining the bulk density and thus the structure and composition of transiting exoplanets. Our analysis builds upon previous community input, including the ExoPlanet Community Report chapter on radial velocities in 2008, the 2010 Decadal Survey of Astronomy, the Penn State Precise Radial Velocities Workshop response to the Decadal Survey in 2010, and the NSF Portfolio Review in 2012. The radial-velocity detection of exoplanets is strongly endorsed by both the Astro 2010 Decadal Survey "New Worlds, New Horizons" and the NSF Portfolio Review, and the community has recommended robust investment in PRVs. The demands on telescope time for the above mission support, especially for systems of small planets, will exceed the number of nights available using instruments now in operation by a factor of at least several for TESS alone. Pushing down towards true Earth twins will require more photons (i.e. larger telescopes), more stable spectrographs than are currently available, better calibration, and better correction for stellar jitter. We outline four hypothetical situations for PRV work necessary to meet NASA mission exoplanet science objectives.},

This facility combines a modern 2.4m computer-controlled telescope with a flexible development environment that enables efficient use of the Levy Spectrometer for high cadence observations. The Levy provides both sub-meter per second radial velocity precision and high efficiency, with a peak total system throughput of 24\%. The modern telescope combined with efficient spectrometer routinely yields over 100 observations of 40 stars in a single night, each of which has velocity errors of 0.7 to 1.4 meters per second, all with typical seeing of {$<$} 1 arc second full-width-half-maximum (FWHM). The whole observing process is automated using a common application programming interface (API) for inter-process communication which allows scripting to be done in a variety of languages (Python, Tcl, bash, csh, etc.) The flexibility and ease-of-use of the common API allowed the science teams to be directly involved in the automation of the observing process, ensuring that the facility met their requirements. Since November 2013, the APF has been routinely conducting autonomous observations without human intervention.},

  abstract = {A new approach for solving Kepler equation for elliptical orbits is developed in this paper. This new approach takes advantage of the very good behaviour of the modified Newton-Raphson method when the initial seed is close to the looked for solution. To determine a good initial seed the eccentric anomaly domain [0, π] is discretized in several intervals and for each one of these intervals a fifth degree interpolating polynomial is introduced. The six coefficients of the polynomial are obtained by requiring six conditions at both ends of the corresponding interval. Thus the real function and the polynomial have equal values at both ends of the interval. Similarly relations are imposed for the two first derivatives. In the singular corner of the Kepler equation, M ≪ 1 and 1 - e ≪ 0 an asymptotic expansion is developed. In most of the cases, the seed generated leads to reach machine error accuracy with the modified Newton-Raphson method with no iterations or just one iteration. This approach improves the computational time compared with other methods currently in use.},

  abstract = {REBOUND is a new multi-purpose N-body code which is freely available under an open-source license. It was designed for collisional dynamics such as planetary rings but can also solve the classical N-body problem. It is highly modular and can be customized easily to work on a wide variety of different problems in astrophysics and beyond. REBOUND comes with three symplectic integrators: leap-frog, the symplectic epicycle integrator (SEI) and a Wisdom-Holman mapping (WH). It supports open, periodic and shearing-sheet boundary conditions. REBOUND can use a Barnes-Hut tree to calculate both self-gravity and collisions. These modules are fully parallelized with MPI as well as OpenMP. The former makes use of a static domain decomposition and a distributed essential tree. Two new collision detection modules based on a plane-sweep algorithm are also implemented. The performance of the plane-sweep algorithm is superior to a tree code for simulations in which one dimension is much longer than the other two and in simulations which are quasi-two dimensional with less than one million particles. In this work, we discuss the different algorithms implemented in REBOUND, the philosophy behind the code's structure as well as implementation specific details of the different modules. We present results of accuracy and scaling tests which show that the code can run efficiently on both desktop machines and large computing clusters.},

  abstract = {High precision, high cadence radial velocity monitoring over the past 8 years at the W. M. Keck Observatory reveals evidence for a third planet orbiting the nearby (4.69 pc) dM4 star GJ 876. The residuals of three-body Newtonian fits, which include GJ 876 and Jupiter mass companions b and c, show significant power at a periodicity of 1.9379 days. Self-consistently fitting the radial velocity data with a model that includes an additional body with this period significantly improves the quality of the fit. These four-body (three-planet) Newtonian fits find that the minimum mass of companion ``d'' is m sin i = 5.89 +- 0.54 Earth masses and that its orbital period is 1.93776 (+- 7x10\^-5) days. Assuming coplanar orbits, an inclination of the GJ 876 planetary system to the plane of the sky of \textasciitilde{} 50 degrees gives the best fit. This inclination yields a mass for companion d of m = 7.53 +- 0.70 Earth masses, making it by far the lowest mass companion yet found around a main sequence star other than our Sun. Precise photometric observations at Fairborn Observatory confirm low-level brightness variability in GJ 876 and provide the first explicit determination of the star's 96.7-day rotation period. Even higher precision short-term photometric measurements obtained at Las Campanas imply that planet d does not transit GJ 876.},

  abstract = {The Optimal Optical Coronagraph (OOC) Workshop at the Lorentz Center in September 2017 in Leiden, the Netherlands gathered a diverse group of 25 researchers working on exoplanet instrumentation to stimulate the emergence and sharing of new ideas. In this first installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from off-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would benefit our community to clearly define quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection significance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise.},

  abstract = {Rigorously quantifying the information in high contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and 2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the existence of extrasolar planets around ultracool dwarfs. Furthermore, binary stars with Sun-like primaries and very low-mass binaries composed of ultracool dwarfs show differences in the distributions of mass ratio and orbital separation that can be indicative of distinct formation mechanisms. Using FORS2/VLT optical imaging for high precision astrometry we are searching for planets and substellar objects around ultracool dwarfs to investigate their multiplicity properties for very low companion masses. Here we report astrometric measurements with an accuracy of two tenths of a milli-arcsecond over two years that reveal orbital motion of the nearby L1.5 dwarf DENIS-P J082303.1-491201 located at 20.77 +/- 0.08 pc caused by an unseen companion that revolves about its host on an eccentric orbit in 246.4 +/- 1.4 days. We estimate the L1.5 dwarf to have 7.5 +/- 0.7 \% of the Sun's mass that implies a companion mass of 28 +/- 2 Jupiter masses. This new system has the smallest mass ratio (0.36 +/- 0.02) of known very low-mass binaries with characterised orbits. With this discovery we demonstrate 200 micro-arcsecond astrometry over an arc-minute field and over several years that is sufficient to discover sub-Jupiter mass planets around ultracool dwarfs. We also show that the achieved parallax accuracy of {$<$} 0.4 \% makes it possible to remove distance as a dominant source of uncertainty in the modelling of ultracool dwarfs.},

Using FORS2/VLT, we obtained position measurements of the star in the plane of the sky that tightly constrain its astrometric reflex motion caused by the super-Jupiter planet "b" in a 1052-day orbit. This allows us to determine the mass of this planet to be, which is \textasciitilde 40\% higher than the minimum mass inferred from the radial-velocity orbit. Using new HARPS radial-velocity measurements, we improve upon the orbital parameters of the inner low-mass planets "d" and "e" and we determine the orbital period of the outer giant planet "c" to be Pc = 7340 days under the assumption of a circular orbit. The preliminary minimum mass of planet "c" is Mcsini = 6.8 MJ with an upper limit of \textasciitilde 39 MJ that we set using NACO/VLT high-contrast imaging. We also determine precise parallaxes and relative proper motions for both GJ 676A and its wide M3 companion GJ 676B. Although the system is probably quite mature, the masses and projected separations (\textasciitilde 0.? 1-0.? 4) of planets "b" and "c" make them promising targets for direct imaging with future instruments in space and on extremely large telescopes. In particular, we estimate that GJ 676A b and GJ 676A c are promising targets for directly detecting their reflected light with the WFIRST space mission. Our study demonstrates the synergy of radial-velocity and astrometric surveys that is necessary to identify the best targets for such a mission.},

To date, the focus has been primarily on two classes of targets: those with known exoplanets discovered indirectly that may be observable by these imaging missions, and those targets with no known planets that have high completeness values (probabilities of planet detections) under some assumptions of the instrument performance and the overall population of exoplanets. A third class of target, however, has received much less scrutiny: stars with known exoplanets that could not possibly be directly imaged due to the size of their orbits. These are planets that would be guaranteed to spend all of their time inside the inner working angles or outside the outer working angles of all currently proposed coronagraphs. However, these systems could potentially harbor additional planets, either exterior to or interior to the currently known planets, but not yet detectable by indirect means. Here, we discuss how to identify systems from all three categories that would be good targets for WFIRST and other, future, space-based imagers. We present a method for assessing the utility of these targets based on an exploration of the available dynamical phase space of the systems that would result in long-term stable orbits for both the currently known and the potentially discoverable companions, and show how it augments existing methods for assessing target completeness and utility.},

We present and discuss the design details of an extensible, modular, open-source software framework called EXOSIMS (Exoplanet Open-Source Imaging Mission Simulator), which creates end-to-end simulations of space-based exoplanet imaging missions. We motivate the development and baseline implementation of the component parts of this software with models of the wide-field infrared survey telescope-astrophysics focused telescope assets (WFIRST-AFTA) coronagraph and present initial results of mission simulations for various iterations of the WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph design. We present and discuss two sets of simulations. The first compares the science yield of completely different instruments in the form of early competing coronagraph designs for WFIRST-AFTA. The second set of simulations evaluates the effects of different operating assumptions, specifically the assumed postprocessing capabilities and telescope vibration levels. We discuss how these results can guide further instrument development and the expected evolution of science yields.},

  abstract = {In the coming years and decades, advanced space-and ground-based observatories will allow an unprecedented opportunity to probe the atmospheres and surfaces of potentially habitable exoplanets for signatures of life. Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties, has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.},

The goal of robust optimization problems is to find an optimal solution that has acceptable sensitivity with respect to uncertain factors. Including integer variables with or without uncertainty can lead to formulations that are computationally expensive to solve. Previous approaches for robust optimization problems under interval uncertainty involve nested optimization or are not applicable to mixed-integer problems where the objective or constraint functions are neither quadratic, nor linear. The overall objective in this paper is to present an efficient robust optimization method that does not contain nested optimization and is applicable to mixed-integer problems with quasiconvex constraints (≤ type) and convex objective function. The proposed method is applied to a variety of numerical examples to test its applicability and numerical evidence is provided for convergence in general as well as some theoretical results for problems with linear constraints.},

This contribution is the final part of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the workshop, and presents an overview of novel optical technologies and systems that are implemented or considered for high-contrast imaging instruments on both ground-based and space telescopes. The overall objective of high contrast instruments is to provide direct observations and characterizations of exoplanets at contrast levels as extreme as 10\textsuperscript{-10}. We list shortcomings of current technologies, and identify opportunities and development paths for new technologies that enable quantum leaps in performance. Specifically, we discuss the design and manufacturing of key components like advanced deformable mirrors and coronagraphic optics, and their amalgamation in "adaptive coronagraph" systems. Moreover, we discuss highly integrated system designs that combine contrast-enhancing techniques and characterization techniques (like high-resolution spectroscopy) while minimizing the overall complexity. Finally, we explore extreme implementations using all-photonics solutions for ground-based telescopes and dedicated huge apertures for space telescopes.},

  abstract = {This paper generalizes to circular apertures the theoretical study of stellar coronagraphy with prolate apodized rectangular entrance apertures of Aime et al. (2002). The main difference between the two studies is that circular prolate spheroidal functions are used for a circular aperture instead of linear prolate spheroidal functions for rectangular apertures. Owing to the radial property of the problem, the solution to the general equation for coronagraphy is solved using a Hankel transform instead of a product of Fourier transforms in the rectangular case. This new theoretical study permits a better understanding of coronagraphy, stressing the importance of entrance pupil apodization. A comparison with the classical unapodized Lyot technique is performed: a typical gain of 104 to 106 can be obtained theoretically with this technique. Circular and rectangular apertures give overall comparable results: a total extinction of the star light is obtained for Roddier \& Roddier's phase mask technique whilst optimal starlight rejections are obtained with a Lyot opaque mask. A precise comparison between a circular aperture and a square aperture of same surface favors the use of a circular aperture for detection of extrasolar planets.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that ice can suppress the formation of any nearby condensation or frost on a substrate. However, these in-plane dry zones require the hygroscopic ice features to be placed on the same surface they are helping to keep dry, which makes it impossible to achieve complete anti-frosting. Here, we create an out-of-plane dry zone by holding two aluminum surfaces parallel to each other, where a uniform sheet of frost was grown on one surface to keep the other surface completely dry. The critical separation required to keep the test surface dry was found to be a function of the ambient supersaturation. We also show that inter-droplet ice bridging, now known to be a primary mechanism for in-plane frost growth, can be similarly extended to an out-of-plane configuration. We freeze a droplet on a hydrophobic surface and suspend a water droplet above it, such that an ice bridge grows toward the water droplet. More generally, these findings show that the recently discovered phenomena of dry zones and ice bridging can be extended to out-of-plane scenarios, which could lead to a better understanding of the behavior of mixed-phase systems.

The mission concept studies for such a mission suggested using the radial velocity exoplanet detection technique to inform when observations should be made. This idea shows promise but the exoplanet yield estimates thus far have not simulated the full process of fitting orbital parameters to an RV curve and attempting to make observations based on the fitted parameters. Current yield estimates assume what the final error on an exoplanet’s orbital parameters will be, which ignores potential relationships between fitted parameters. Here we show how to calculate the probability of directly imaging an exoplanet detected via radial velocity, explain how that metric can be validated through yield estimates, and demonstrate improvements to tools necessary for the yield calculations.},

In the first half of the mission they make a series of predetermined observations and revisit promising targets in the second half. However, this kind of mission schedule risks missing the optimal times to revisit promising target stars when the optimal times fall in the first half of the mission. Here, we show a method for a fully dynamic mission schedule. To do this we simulate a cloud of planets around a star and identify which planets in the cloud would be detectable to the telescope. Then with a maximization procedure, we calculate both the optimal time to revisit the star and the science yield at that time, using the detectable planets in the simulation and whether a detection was made by the mission. We show mission simulation results comparing the approaches and demonstrate that when implemented, this process allows a mission to focus on the most beneficial target stars and provides information on observed exoplanets, such as better bounds for orbital parameters, that a more static mission plan cannot.},

This creates chances for an observatory to image an exoplanet multiple times and to image exoplanets discovered by other observatories after the mission begins. For example, the HabEx and LUVOIR missions have a partially dynamic schedules, beginning with a series of predetermined observations whose outcome sets the schedule of followup observations. An orbital fit can be created for an exoplanet that has been observed by other observatories, which helps determine when it will be observable again. However, these fits have uncertainties that propagate in time. We show simulations demonstrating how these errors propagate and compare different methods of estimating when a planet will be visible.},

  abstract = {Future direct imaging mission concepts are planning to observe planets discovered via Doppler spectroscopy, with observation scheduling decisions based on radial velocity (RV) fit orbits to increase the mission’s odds of making a detection. However, some orbital parameters, such as inclination and planet radius, that are necessary to determine when a planet is detectable via imaging cannot be resolved with only RV data. This work studies how to best use a RV fit to determine when a planet will be detectable with direct imaging and quantify the impacts of RV-measurement precision on direct imaging observations. Beginning by defining a “true” planet, we simulate RV observations, fit the RV observations via Bayesian orbit fitting, construct many Keplerian orbits based on the RV fit and priors on the unknown orbital parameters, and propagate the constructed orbits and the true orbit for 20 yr to determine when the constructed orbits deviate significantly. We identify four methods of constructing orbits, ultimately finding that creating and sampling high-likelihood orbital parameters from a multivariate Gaussian produces the best results for high RV error and that creating and sampling from a simple normal distribution for each orbital parameter independently performs the best for low RV error. Further, we establish two modes of failure: intermittent failure, which captures when the constructed orbits incorrectly indicate that a planet is detectable; and dispersion failure, when the constructed orbits have dispersed so much that they no longer provide useful information.},

This inherent hygroscopic quality of ice has recently been exploited to suppress frost growth by patterning microscopic ice stripes along a surface. These vapor-attracting ice stripes prevented condensation frosting from occurring in the intermediate regions; however, the required presence of the sacrificial ice stripes made it impossible to achieve the ideal case of a completely dry surface. Here, we decouple the sacrificial ice from the antifrosting surface by holding an uncoated aluminum surface in parallel with a prefrosted surface. By replacing the overlapping in-plane dry zones with a uniform out-of-plane dry zone, we show that even an uncoated aluminum surface can stay almost completely dry in chilled and supersaturated conditions. Using a blend of experiments and numerical simulations, we show that the critical separation required to keep the surface dry is a function of the ambient supersaturation.},

  abstract = {The expected yield of potentially Earth-like planets is a useful metric for designing future exoplanet-imaging missions. Recent yield studies of direct-imaging missions have focused primarily on yield methods and trade studies using "toy" models of missions. Here, we increase the fidelity of these calculations substantially, adopting more realistic exoplanet demographics as input, an improved target list, and a realistic distribution of exozodi levels. Most importantly, we define standardized inputs for instrument simulations, use these standards to directly compare the performance of realistic instrument designs, include the sensitivity of coronagraph contrast to stellar diameter, and adopt engineering-based throughputs and detector parameters. We apply these new high-fidelity yield models to study several critical design trades: monolithic versus segmented primary mirrors (PMs), on-axis versus off-axis secondary mirrors, and coronagraphs versus starshades. We show that as long as the gap size between segments is sufficiently small ({$<$}0.1 \% of telescope diameter), there is no difference in yield for coronagraph-based missions with monolithic off-axis telescopes and segmented off-axis telescopes, assuming that the requisite engineering constraints imposed by the coronagraph can be met in both scenarios. We show that there is currently a factor of ∼2 yield penalty for coronagraph-based missions with on-axis telescopes compared to off-axis telescopes, and note that there is room for improvement in coronagraph designs for on-axis telescopes. We also reproduce previous results in higher fidelity, showing that the yields of coronagraph-based missions continue to increase with aperture size while the yields of starshade-based missions turnover at large apertures if refueling is not possible. Finally, we provide absolute yield numbers with uncertainties that include all major sources of astrophysical noise to guide future mission design.},

Here we describe a method for exoEarth candidate yield maximization that simultaneously optimizes, for the first time, the targets chosen for observation, the number of visits to each target, the delay time between visits, and the exposure time of every observation. This code calculates both the detection time and multi-wavelength spectral characterization time required for planets. We also refine the astrophysical assumptions used as inputs to these calculations, relying on published estimates of planetary occurrence rates as well as theoretical and observational constraints on terrestrial planet sizes and classical habitable zones. Given these astrophysical assumptions, optimistic telescope and instrument assumptions, and our new completeness code that produces the highest yields to date, we suggest lower limits on the aperture size required to detect and characterize a statistically motivated sample of exoEarths.},

Here we estimate exoEarth candidate yield using single visit completeness for a variety of mission design and astrophysical parameters. We review the methods used in previous yield calculations and show that the method choice can significantly impact yield estimates as well as how the yield responds to mission parameters. We introduce a method, called Altruistic Yield Optimization, that optimizes the target list and exposure times to maximize mission yield, adapts maximally to changes in mission parameters, and increases exoEarth candidate yield by up to 100\% compared to previous methods. We use Altruistic Yield Optimization to estimate exoEarth candidate yield for a large suite of mission and astrophysical parameters using single visit completeness. We find that exoEarth candidate yield is most sensitive to telescope diameter, followed by coronagraph inner working angle, followed by coronagraph contrast, and finally coronagraph contrast noise floor. We find a surprisingly weak dependence of exoEarth candidate yield on exozodi level. Additionally, we provide a quantitative approach to defining a yield goal for future exoEarth-imaging missions.},

  abstract = {A probabilistic description is essential for understanding growth processes far from equilibrium. In this paper, we compute time-dependent Probability Density Functions (PDFs) in order to investigate stochastic logistic and Gompertz models, which are two of the most popular growth models. We consider different types of short-correlated internal (multiplicative) and external (additive) stochastic noises and compare the time-dependent PDFs in the two models, elucidating the effects of the additive and multiplicative noises on the form of PDFs. We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a bimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the additive noise. A much weaker (leaky) attractor in the Gompertz model leads to a significant (singular) growth of the population of a very small size. We point out the limitation of using stationary PDFs, mean value and variance in understanding statistical properties of the growth far from equilibrium, highlighting the importance of time-dependent PDFs. We further compare these two models from the perspective of information change that occurs during the growth process. Specifically, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time by comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in time. The total distance along the trajectory quantifies the total number of different states that the system undergoes in time, and is called the information length. We show that the time-evolution of the two models become more similar when measured in units of the information length and point out the merit of using the information length in unifying and understanding the dynamic evolution of different growth processes.},

The transition probability density function is approximated by a finite sum of Gaussian density functions for which the parameters (mean and covariance) are propagated using linear propagation theory. Two different approaches are introduced to update the weights of different components of a Gaussian-mixture model for uncertainty propagation through nonlinear system. The first method updates the weights such that they minimize the integral square difference between the true forecast probability density function and its Gaussian-sum approximation. The second method uses the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation error as feedback to adapt for the amplitude of different Gaussian components while solving a quadratic programming problem. The proposed methods are applied to a variety of problems in the open literature and are argued to be an excellent candidate for higher-dimensional uncertainty-propagation problems.},

  abstract = {Model verification and validation (V\&V) is an enabling methodology for the development of computational models that can be used to make engineering predictions with quantified confidence. Model V\&V procedures are needed by government and industry to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with full-scale test ing of products, materials, and weapon systems. Quantifying the confidence and predictive accuracy of model calculations provides the decision-maker with the information necessary for making high-consequence decisions. The development of guidelines and procedures for conducting a model V\&V program are currently being defined by a broad spectrum of researchers. This report reviews the concepts involved in such a program. Model V\&V is a current topic of great interest to both government and industry. In response to a ban on the production of new strategic weapons and nuclear testing, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Science- Based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). An objective of the SSP is to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This objective has challenged the national laboratories to develop high-confidence tools and methods that can be used to provide credible models needed for stockpile certification via numerical simulation. There has been a significant increase in activity recent ly to define V\&V methods and procedures. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is working to develop fundamental concepts and terminology for V\&V applied to high-level systems such as ballistic missile defense and battle management simulations. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has recently formed a Standards Committee for the development of V\&V procedures for computational solid mechanics models. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has been a proponent of model V\&V for all safety-related nuclear facility design, analyses, and operations. In fact, DNFSB 2002-1 1 recommends to the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that a V\&V process be performed for all safety related software and analysis. Model verification and validation are the primary processes for quantifying and building credibility in numerical models. Verification is the process of determining that a model implementation accurately represents the developer’s conceptual description of the model and its solution. Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. Both verification and validation are processes that accumulat e evidence of a model’s correctness or accuracy for a specific scenario; thus, V\&V cannot prove that a model is co rrect and accurate for all possible scenarios, but, rather, it can provide evidence that the model is sufficiently accurate for its intended use. vi Model V\&V is fundamentally different from software V\&V. Code developers developing computer programs perform software V\&V to ensure code correctness, reliability, and robustness. In model V\&V, the end product is a predictive model based on fundamental physics of the problem being solved. In all applications of practical interest, the calculations involved in obtaining solutions with the mode l require a computer code, e.g., finite element or finite difference analysis. Therefore, engineers seeking to devel op credible predictive models critically need model V\&V guidelines and procedures. The expected outcome of the model V\& V process is the quantified level of agreement between experimental data and model prediction, as well as the predictive accuracy of the model. This report attempts to describe the general philosophy, definitions, concepts, and processes for conducting a successful V\&V program. This objective is motivated by the need for highly accurate numerical models for making predictions to support the SSP, and also by the lack of guidelines, standards and procedures for performing V\&V for complex numerical models.},

This version, ExoCat-1, includes 2347 stars taken from the Hipparcos Catalogue with measured parallaxes {$>$} 33.33 mas (corresponding to a distance of 30 pc). This sample is nearly complete down to V=8, corresponding to stars brighter than \textasciitilde 0.5 solar luminosities (late G-/early K-type dwarf stars at the 30 pc distance limit). For each star we provide astrometry (including Equatorial and Galactic coordinates, parallax, and proper motions), Johnson B and V magnitudes (converted from Hipparcos or Tycho data or taken from the literature), and Ks-band magnitudes from 2MASS (for fainter stars) or K-band magnitudes taken from the literature and converted to 2MASS Ks magnitudes (for bright stars). Using these data we estimate stellar luminosity, effective temperature, stellar radius (in solar and angular units), Earth-equivalent insolation distances (in AU and in angular units), and fraction planet brightness for an exo=Earth at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance. We provide published spectral types and simple labels on stellar type for quick assessment of design reference mission-selected targets lists. The number of known exoplanet companions is indicated for each star, and for bright stars (V{$<$}7) we provide separations and delta-magnitudes for the brightest stellar companion within 10 arcseconds. Other important stellar data such as log(g), chromospheric activity level, and age estimates are provided where readily available. ExoCat-1 can be found through the Exoplanets Exploration Program (ExEP) website.},

  abstract = {As part of NASA's mission to explore habitable planets orbiting nearby stars, this article explores the detection and characterization capabilities of a 4 m space telescope plus 50 m starshade located at the Earth-Sun L2 point, known as the New Worlds Observer (NWO). Our calculations include the true spectral types and distribution of stars on the sky, an iterative target selection protocol designed to maximize efficiency based on prior detections, and realistic mission constraints. We conduct simulated observing runs for a wide range in exozodiacal background levels (ɛ = 1--100 times the local zodi brightness) and overall prevalence of Earth-like terrestrial planets (η⊕=0.1-1). We find that even without any return visits, the NWO baseline architecture (IWA = 65 mas, limiting FPB = 4×10-11) can achieve a 95\% probability of detecting and spectrally characterizing at least one habitable Earth-like planet and an expectation value of ˜3 planets found, within the mission lifetime and ΔV budgets, even in the worst-case scenario (η⊕ =0.1 and ɛ = 100 zodis for every target). This achievement requires about 1 yr of integration time spread over the 5 yr mission, leaving the remainder of the telescope time for UV-NIR general astrophysics. Cost and technical feasibility considerations point to a ""sweet spot"" in starshade design near a 50 m starshade effective diameter, with 12 or 16 petals, at a distance of 70,000--100,000 km from the telescope.},

We use the TESS Candidate Target List 6 (CTL-6) as an input catalog of over 4 million sources. We predict that from the 200,000 stars selected to be observed with the high-cadence postage stamps with the highest CTL-6 priority, there will be 241 single-transit events caused by planets detectable at a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR\$\textbackslash ge7.3\$. We find a lower limit of an additional 977 events caused by single-transit planets in the full frame images (FFI); this is a lower limit because the CTL-6 is incomplete below a TESS magnitude of \$T{$>$}12\$. Of the single-transit events from the postage stamps and FFIs, 1091/1218 will have transit depths deeper than 0.1\%, and will thus be amenable for photometric follow-up from the ground, and 1195/1218 will have radial velocity signals greater than 1 m/s. We estimate that the periods of 146 single transits will be constrained to better than 10\% using the TESS photometry assuming circular orbits. We find that the number of planets detected by TESS in the postage stamps with periods \$P{$>$}25\$ days will be doubled by including single-transiting planets, while the number of planets with \$P{$>$}250\$ days will be increased by an order of magnitude. We predict 79 habitable zone planets from single-transits, with 18 orbiting FGK stars.},

  abstract = {All extra-solar planet masses that have been derived spectroscopically are lower limits since the inclination of the orbit to our line-of-sight is unknown except for transiting systems. In theory, however, it is possible to determine the inclination angle, i, between the rotation axis of a star and an observer's line-of-sight from measurements of the projected equatorial velocity (v sin i), the stellar rotation period (Prot) and the stellar radius (R*). For stars which host planetary systems this allows the removal of the sin i dependency of extra-solar planet masses derived from spectroscopic observations under the assumption that the planetary orbits lie perpendicular to the stellar rotation axis. We have carried out an extensive literature search and present a catalogue of v sin i, Prot and R* estimates for stars hosting extra-solar planets. In addition, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes and the Barnes-Evans relationship to further supplement the R* estimates obtained from the literature. Using this catalogue, we have obtained sin i estimates using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis. This technique allows proper 1σ two-tailed confidence limits to be placed on the derived sin i's along with the transit probability for each planet to be determined. While we find that a small proportion of systems yield sin i's significantly greater than 1, most likely due to poor Prot estimations, the large majority are acceptable. We are further encouraged by the cases where we have data on transiting systems, as the technique indicates inclinations of \textasciitilde 90° and high transit probabilities. In total, we are able to estimate the true masses of 133 extra-solar planets. Of these 133 extra-solar planets, only six have revised masses that place them above the 13MJ deuterium burning limit; four of those six extra-solar planet candidates were already suspected to lie above the deuterium burning limit before correcting their masses for the sin i dependency. Our work reveals a population of high-mass extra-solar planets with low eccentricities, and we speculate that these extra-solar planets may represent the signature of different planetary formation mechanisms at work. Finally, we discuss future observations that should improve the robustness of this technique. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 RAS.},

As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

We include details of calculating analytic derivatives for use in the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for the problems of fitting RV and astrometric data separately and jointly. We also explicate the general method of separating the linear and nonlinear components of a model fit in the context of an LM fit, show how explicit derivatives can be calculated in such a model, and demonstrate the speed up and convergence improvements of such a scheme in the case of a five-planet fit to published RV data for 55 Cnc. © 2009.

We describe the theory and implementation of accounting for the effects on precise Doppler measurements of motion of the telescope through space, primarily from rotational and orbital motion of the Earth, and the motion of the solar system with respect to target star (i.e. the "barycentric correction"). We describe the minimal algorithm necessary to accomplish this and how it differs from a na\textbackslash "ive subtraction of velocities (i.e. a Galilean transformation). We demonstrate the validity of code we have developed from the California Planet Survey code via comparison with the pulsar timing package, TEMPO2. We estimate the magnitude of various terms and effects, including relativistic effects, and the errors associated with incomplete knowledge of telescope position, timing, and stellar position and motion. We note that chromatic aberration will create uncertainties in the time of observation, which will complicate efforts to detect true Earth analogs. Our code is available for public use and validation.},

  abstract = {Several small dense exoplanets are now known, inviting comparisons to Earth and Venus. Such comparisons require translating their masses and sizes to composition models of evolved multi-layer-interior planets. Such theoretical models rely on our understanding of the Earth's interior, as well as independently derived equations of state (EOS), but have so far not involved direct extrapolations from Earth's seismic model -PREM. In order to facilitate more detailed compositional comparisons between small exoplanets and the Earth, we derive here a semi-empirical mass-radius relation for two-layer rocky planets based on PREM: \$\{\textbackslash frac\{R\}\{R\_\textbackslash oplus\}\} = (1.07-0.21\textbackslash cdot \textbackslash text\{CMF\})\textbackslash cdot (\textbackslash frac\{M\}\{M\_\textbackslash oplus\})\^\{1/3.7\}\$, where CMF stands for Core Mass Fraction. It is applicable to 1\$\textbackslash sim\$8 M\$\_\{\textbackslash oplus\}\$ and CMF of 0.0\$\textbackslash sim\$0.4. Applying this formula to Earth and Venus and several known small exoplanets with radii and masses measured to better than \$\textbackslash sim\$30\textbackslash\% precision gives a CMF fit of \$0.26\textbackslash pm0.07\$.},

  abstract = {We present the identification of the COCONUTS-2 system, composed of the M3 dwarf L 34-26 and the T9 dwarf WISEPA J075108.79\$-\$763449.6. Given their common proper motions and parallaxes, these two field objects constitute a physically bound pair with a projected separation of 594\$"\$ (6471 au). The primary star COCONUTS-2A has strong stellar activity (H\$\textbackslash alpha\$, X-ray, and UV emission) and is rapidly rotating (\$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\} = 2.83\$ days), from which we estimate an age of 150-800 Myr. Comparing equatorial rotational velocity derived from the TESS light curve to spectroscopic \$v\textbackslash sin\{i\}\$, we find COCONUTS-2A has a nearly edge-on inclination. The wide exoplanet COCONUTS-2b has an effective temperature of \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=434 \textbackslash pm 9\$ K, a surface gravity of \$\textbackslash log\{g\} = 4.11\^\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.18\}\$ dex, and a mass of \$M=6.3\^\{+1.5\}\_\{-1.9\}\$ \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ based on hot-start evolutionary models, leading to a \$0.016\^\{+0.004\}\_\{-0.005\}\$ mass ratio for the COCONUTS-2 system. COCONUTS-2b is the second coldest (after WD 0806\$-\$661B) and the second widest (after TYC 9486-927-1 b) exoplanet imaged to date. Comparison of COCONUTS-2b's infrared photometry with ultracool model atmospheres suggests the presence of both condensate clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry in its photosphere. Similar to 51 Eri b, COCONUTS-2b has a sufficiently low luminosity (\$\textbackslash log\{(L\_\{\textbackslash rm bol\}/L\_\{\textbackslash odot\})\} = -6.384 \textbackslash pm 0.028\$ dex) to be consistent with the cold-start process that may form gas-giant (exo)planets, though its large separation means such formation would not have occurred in situ. Finally, at a distance of 10.9 pc, COCONUTS-2b is the nearest imaged exoplanet to Earth known to date.},
